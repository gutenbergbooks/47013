<p class="noindent" style="font-size: .9em; page-break-before: avoid;"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he titlepage of this book explains its plan
and purpose. The Courses of Reading
and the Schemes for Practical Study, herein
indicated, are the outgrowth of the Author’s
long experience as a lover of books and director
of reading. They have been tested and found
to be all that is claimed for them. As to the
large number of quotations in the first part
of the book, they are given in the belief that
“in a multitude of counsels there is wisdom.”
And the Author finds consolation and encouragement
in the following words of Emerson:
“We are as much informed of a writer’s genius
by what he selects, as by what he originates.
We read the quotation with his eyes, and find
a new and fervent sense.” As the value of
the most useful inventions depends upon the<span class="pagenum">vi</span>
ingenious placing of their parts, so the originality
of this work may be found to lie chiefly
in its arrangement. Yet the writer confidently
believes that his readers will enjoy that which
he has borrowed, and possibly find aid and
encouragement in that which he claims as his
own; and therefore this book is sent out with
the hope that book-lovers will find in it a safe
Guide to the Best Reading.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent"><span class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/l.png" width="80" height="79" alt="L" /></span>ET
us consider how great a commodity
of doctrine exists in Books;
how easily, how secretly, how safely
they expose the nakedness of human
ignorance without putting it to shame.
These are the masters who instruct us without
rods and ferules, without hard words and
anger, without clothes or money. If you approach
them, they are not asleep; if investigating
you interrogate them, they conceal
nothing; if you mistake them, they never
grumble; if you are ignorant, they cannot
laugh at you.</p>

<p>You only, O Books, are liberal and independent.
You give to all who ask, and
enfranchise all who serve you assiduously.
Truly, you are the ears filled with most palatable
grains. You are golden urns in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
manna is laid up; rocks flowing with honey,
or rather, indeed, honeycombs; udders most
copiously yielding the milk of life; store-rooms
ever full; the four-streamed river of
Paradise, where the human mind is fed, and
the arid intellect moistened and watered;
fruitful olives; vines of Engaddi; fig-trees
knowing no sterility; burning lamps to be
ever held in the hand.</p>

<p>The library, therefore, of wisdom is more
precious than all riches; and nothing that can
be wished for is worthy to be compared with
it. Whosoever acknowledges himself to be
a zealous follower of truth, of happiness, of
wisdom, of science, or even of the faith, must
of necessity make himself a Lover of Books.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Richard de Bury, 1344.</span>
</p>

<p>Books are friends whose society is extremely
agreeable to me; they are of all ages,
and of every country. They have distinguished
themselves both in the cabinet and in
the field, and obtained high honors for their
knowledge of the sciences. It is easy to gain
access to them; for they are always at my
service, and I admit them to my company,
and dismiss them from it, whenever I please.
They are never troublesome, but immediately
answer every question I ask them. Some
relate to me the events of past ages, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
others reveal to me the secrets of Nature.
Some teach me how to live, and others how
to die. Some, by their vivacity, drive away
my cares and exhilarate my spirits; while
others give fortitude to my mind, and teach
me the important lesson how to restrain my
desires, and to depend wholly on myself.
They open to me, in short, the various avenues
of all the arts and sciences, and upon their
information I safely rely in all emergencies.
In return for all these services, they only ask
me to accommodate them with a convenient
chamber in some corner of my humble habitation,
where they may repose in peace; for
these friends are more delighted by the tranquility
of retirement, than with the tumults
of society.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Francesco Petrarca.</span>
</p>

<p>Books are the Glasse of Counsell to dress
ourselves by. They are Life’s best Business:
Vocation to them hath more Emolument
coming in, than all the other busie Termes
of Life. They are Feelesse Counsellours, no
delaying Patrons, of easie Accesse, and kind
Expedition, never sending away any Client
or Petitioner. They are for Company, the
best Friends; in doubts, Counsellours; in
Damp, Comforters; Time’s Perspective; the
home Traveller’s Ship, or Horse; the busie
Man’s best Recreation; the Opiate of idle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
Wearinesse; the Mind’s best Ordinary; Nature’s
Garden and Seed-plot of Immortality.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A Writer of the Sixteenth Century</span>
(quoted in “Allibone’s Dictionary”).
</p>

<p>But how can I live here without my books?
I really seem to myself crippled and only half
myself; for if, as the great Orator used to say,
arms are a soldier’s members, surely books
are the limbs of scholars. Corasius says: “Of
a truth, he who would deprive me of books,
my old friends, would take away all the delight
of my life; nay, I will even say, all desire
of living.”</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Balthasar Bonifacius Rhodiginus, 1656.</span>
</p>

<p>For books are not absolutely dead things,
but do contain a potency of life in them to
be as active as that soul was whose progeny
they are; nay, they do preserve, as in a vial,
the purest efficacy and extraction of that
living intellect that bred them. I know they
are as lively and as vigorously productive
as those fabulous dragon’s teeth, and, being
sown up and down, may chance to spring up
armed men.... Many a man lives, a burden
to the earth; but a good book is the precious
life-blood of a master spirit, embalmed
and treasured up on purpose for a life
beyond life.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">John Milton.</span>
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>
<p>Books are a guide in youth, and an entertainment
for age. They support us under
solitude, and keep us from being a burden to
ourselves. They help us to forget the crossness
of men and things, compose our cares
and our passions, and lay our disappointments
asleep. When we are weary of the
living, we may repair to the dead, who have
nothing of peevishness, pride, or design in
their conversation.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Jeremy Collier.</span>
</p>

<p>God be thanked for books! They are the
voices of the distant and the dead, and make
us heirs of the spiritual life of past ages.
Books are the true levellers. They give to
all who will faithfully use them, the society,
the spiritual presence, of the best and greatest
of our race. No matter how poor I am; no
matter though the prosperous of my own
time will not enter my obscure dwelling; if
the sacred writers will enter and take up
their abode under my roof,&mdash;if Milton will
cross my threshold to sing to me of Paradise;
and Shakspeare to open to me the worlds of
imagination and the workings of the human
heart; and Franklin to enrich me with his
practical wisdom,&mdash;I shall not pine for want
of intellectual companionship, and I may
become a cultivated man, though excluded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
from what is called the best society in the
place where I live.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">William Ellery Channing.</span>
</p>

<p>In a corner of my house I have books,&mdash;the
miracle of all my possessions, more wonderful
than the wishing-cap of the Arabian
tales; for they transport me instantly, not only
to all places, but to all times. By my books
I can conjure up before me to a momentary
existence many of the great and good men of
past ages, and for my individual satisfaction
they seem to act again the most renowned of
their achievements; the orators declaim for
me, the historians recite, the poets sing.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Dr. Arnott.</span>
</p>

<p>Wondrous, indeed, is the virtue of a true
book! Not like a dead city of stones,
yearly crumbling, yearly needing repair;
more like a tilled field, but then a spiritual
field; like a spiritual tree, let me rather say,
it stands from year to year and from age to
age (we have books that already number some
hundred and fifty human ages); and yearly
comes its new produce of leaves (commentaries,
deductions, philosophical, political systems;
or were it only sermons, pamphlets,
journalistic essays), every one of which is
talismanic and thaumaturgic, for it can persuade
man. O thou who art able to write a
book, which once in two centuries or oftener<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
there is a man gifted to do, envy not him
whom they name city-builder, and inexpressibly
pity him whom they name conqueror or
city-burner! Thou, too, art a conqueror and
victor; but of the true sort, namely, over the
Devil. Thou, too, hast built what will outlast
all marble and metal, and be a wonder-bringing
city of mind, a temple and seminary
and prophetic mount, whereto all kindreds
of the earth will pilgrim.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Thomas Carlyle.</span>
</p>

<p>Good books, like good friends, are few and
chosen; the more select, the more enjoyable;
and like these are approached with diffidence,
nor sought too familiarly nor too often, having
the precedence only when friends tire.
The most mannerly of companions, accessible
at all times, in all moods, they frankly declare
the author’s mind, without giving offence.
Like living friends, they too have their voice
and physiognomies, and their company is
prized as old acquaintances. We seek them
in our need of counsel or of amusement, without
impertinence or apology, sure of having
our claims allowed. A good book justifies
our theory of personal supremacy, keeping
this fresh in the memory and perennial. What
were days without such fellowship? We were
alone in the world without it.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A. Bronson Alcott.</span>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<p>Consider what you have in the smallest
chosen library. A company of the wisest and
wittiest men that could be picked out of all
civil countries, in a thousand years, have set
in best order the results of their learning and
wisdom. The men themselves were hid and
inaccessible, solitary, impatient of interruption,
fenced by etiquette; but the thought which
they did not uncover to their bosom friend
is here written out in transparent words to
us, the strangers of another age. We owe
to books those general benefits which come
from high intellectual action. Thus, I think,
we often owe to them the perception of
immortality. They impart sympathetic activity
to the moral power. Go with mean
people, and you think life is mean. Then
read Plutarch, and the world is a proud place,
peopled with men of positive quality, with
heroes and demi-gods standing around us,
who will not let us sleep. Then they address
the imagination: only poetry inspires
poetry. They become the organic culture of
the time. College education is the reading
of certain books which the common sense of
all scholars agrees will represent the science
already accumulated.... In the highest
civilization the book is still the highest
delight.</p>

<p class="right">

</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>A great book that comes from a great
thinker,&mdash;it is a ship of thought, deep-freighted
with truth, with beauty too. It
sails the ocean, driven by the winds of heaven,
breaking the level sea of life into beauty where
it goes, leaving behind it a train of sparkling
loveliness, widening as the ship goes on. And
what a treasure it brings to every land, scattering
the seeds of truth, justice, love, and
piety, to bless the world in ages yet to come!</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Theodore Parker.</span>
</p>

<p>What is a great love of books? It is
something like a personal introduction to the
great and good men of all past times. Books,
it is true, are silent as you see them on their
shelves; but, silent as they are, when I enter
a library I feel as if almost the dead were
present, and I know if I put questions to
these books they will answer me with all the
faithfulness and fulness which has been left
in them by the great men who have left the
books with us.</p>

<p>Books are our household gods; and we
cannot prize them too highly. They are the
only gods in all the mythologies that are
beautiful and unchangeable; for they betray
no man, and love their lovers. I confess myself
an idolater of this literary religion, and
am grateful for the blessed ministry of books.
It is a kind of heathenism which needs no
missionary funds, no Bible even, to abolish
it; for the Bible itself caps the peak of this
new Olympus, and crowns it with sublimity
and glory. Amongst the many things we
have to be thankful for, as the result of
modern discoveries, surely this of printed
books is the highest of all; and I, for one,
am so sensible of its merits that I never think
of the name of Gutenberg without feelings of
veneration and homage.</p>

<p>The only true equalizers in the world are
books; the only treasure-house open to all
comers is a library; the only wealth which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
will not decay is knowledge; the only jewel
which you can carry beyond the grave is
wisdom. To live in this equality, to share in
these treasures, to possess this wealth, and
to secure this jewel may be the happy lot of
every one. All that is needed for the acquisition
of these inestimable treasures is the
love of books.</p>

<p>Let us thank God for books. When I
consider what some books have done for the
world, and what they are doing; how they
keep up our hope, awaken new courage and
faith, soothe pain, give an ideal life to those
whose homes are hard and cold, bind together
distant ages and foreign lands, create
new worlds of beauty, bring down truths
from heaven,&mdash;I give eternal blessings for
this gift, and pray that we may use it aright,
and abuse it not.</p>

<p>A motion of the hand brings all Arcadia to
sight. The war of Troy can, at our bidding,
rage in the narrowest chamber. Without
stirring from our firesides, we may roam to
the most remote regions of the earth, or soar
into realms where Spenser’s shapes of unearthly
beauty flock to meet us, where Milton’s
angels peal in our ears the choral hymns of
Paradise. Science, art, literature, philosophy,&mdash;all
that man has thought, all that man has
done,&mdash;the experience that has been bought
with the sufferings of a hundred generations,&mdash;all
are garnered up for us in the world of
books. There, among realities, in a “substantial
world,” we move with the crowned
kings of thought. There our minds have a
free range, our hearts a free utterance. Reason
is confined within none of the partitions
which trammel it in life. In that world, no
divinity hedges a king, no accident of rank or
fashion ennobles a dunce or shields a knave.
We can select our companions from among
the most richly gifted of the sons of God;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>

<p>For what a world of books offers itself, in
all subjects, arts, and sciences, to the sweet
content and capacity of the reader? In arithmetic,
geometry, perspective, optics, astronomy,
architecture, <i>sculptura</i>, <i>pictura</i>, of which
so many and such elaborate treatises are of
late written; in mechanics and their mysteries,
military matters, navigation, riding of horses,
fencing, swimming, gardening, planting, etc....
What so sure, what so pleasant? What
vast tomes are extant in law, physic, and
divinity, for profit, pleasure, practice, speculation,
in verse or prose! Their names alone
are the subject of whole volumes; we have
thousands of authors of all sorts, many great
libraries, full well furnished, like so many
dishes of meat, served out for several palates,
and he is a very block that is affected with
none of them.</p>

<p>Except a living man, there is nothing more

miles away; and yet these, on those little
sheets of paper, speak to us, amuse us, vivify
us, teach us, comfort us, open their hearts to
us as brothers. We ought to reverence books,
to look at them as useful and mighty things.

<p class="center"><b>On the Choice of Books.</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> choice of books is not the least part of the duty of
a scholar. If he would become a man, and worthy to deal
with manlike things, he must read only the bravest and noblest
books,&mdash;books forged at the heart and fashioned by
the intellect of a godlike man.&mdash;<span class="smcap">January Searle.</span></p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent"><span class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/t.png" width="80" height="81" alt="T" /></span>HE most important question for you
to ask yourself, be you teacher or
scholar, is this: What books shall
I read? For him who has inclination
to read, there is no dearth of reading
matter, and it is obtainable almost for the
asking. Books are in a manner thrust upon
you almost daily. Shall you read without discrimination
whatever comes most readily to
hand? As well say that you will accept as
a friend and companion every man whom you
meet on the street. Shall you read even
every good book that comes in your way,<span class="pagenum padl2"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
simply because it is harmless and interesting?
It is not every harmless book, nor indeed
every good book, that will make your mind
the richer for the reading of it. Never, perhaps,
has the right choice of books been
more difficult than at present; and never did
it behoove more strongly both teachers and
scholars to look well to the character of that
which they read.</p>

<p>First, then, let us consider what books we
are to avoid. All will agree that those which
are really and absolutely bad should be
shunned as we shun a pestilence. In these
last years of the nineteenth century there is
no more prolific cause of evil than bad books.
There are many books so utterly vile that
there is no mistaking their character, and no
question as to whether they should be avoided.
There are others which are a thousand-fold
more dangerous because they come to us
disguised,&mdash;“wolves in sheep’s clothing,”&mdash;affecting
a character of harmlessness, if not
of sanctity. I have heard those who ought to
know better, laugh at the silly jokes of a very
silly book, and offer by way of excuse that
there was nothing <i>very</i> bad in it. I have
heard teachers recommend to their pupils
reading matter which, to say the least, was of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
a very doubtful character. Now, the only
excuse that can be offered in such cases is
ignorance,&mdash;“I didn’t know there was any
harm in the book.” But the teacher who
through ignorance poisons the moral character
and checks the mental growth of his
pupils is as guilty of criminal carelessness as
the druggist’s clerk who by mistake sells arsenic
for quinine. Step down and out of that
responsible position which you are in no wise
qualified to fill! The direction of the pupils’
habits of reading, the choice of reading matter
for them, is by no means the least of the
teacher’s duties.</p>

<p>The elder Pliny, eighteen hundred years
ago, was accustomed to say that no book was
so bad but that some part of it might be read
with profit. This may have been true in
Pliny’s time; but it is very far from correct
now-a-days. A large number of books, and
many which attain an immense circulation,
are but the embodiment of evil from beginning
to end; others, although not absolutely
and aggressively bad, contain not a single
line that can be read with profit.</p>

<p>What are the sure criterions of a bad book?
There is no better authority on this subject
than the Rev. Robert Collyer. He says: “If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
when I read a book about God, I find that it
has put Him farther from me; or about man,
that it has put me farther from him; or about
this universe, that it has shaken down upon it
a new look of desolation, turning a green field
into a wild moor; or about life, that it has
made it seem a little less worth living, on all
accounts, than it was; or about moral principles,
that they are not quite so clear and
strong as they were when this author began
to talk;&mdash;then I know that on any of these
five cardinal things in the life of man,&mdash;his
relations to God, to his fellows, to the world
about him, and the world within him, and
the great principles on which all things stable
centre,&mdash;<i>that</i>, for me, is a bad book. It may
chime in with some lurking appetite in my
own nature, and so seem to be as sweet as
honey to my taste; but it comes to bitter, bad
results. It may be food for another; I can
say nothing to that. He may be a pine while
I am a palm. I only know this, that in these
great first things, if the book I read shall touch
them at all, it shall touch them to my profit
or I will not read it. Right and wrong shall
grow more clear; life in and about me more
divine; I shall come nearer to my fellows,
and God nearer to me, or the thing is a poi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>son.
Faust, or Calvin, or Carlyle, if any one
of these cardinal things is the grain and the
grist of the book, and that is what it comes to
when I read it, I am being drugged and poisoned;
and the sooner I know it the better.
I want bread, and meat, and milk, not brandy,
or opium, or hasheesh.”<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>And Robert Southey, the poet, expresses
nearly the same thing: “Young readers,&mdash;you
whose hearts are open, whose understandings
are not yet hardened, and whose feelings are
not yet exhausted nor encrusted with the
world,&mdash;take from me a better rule than any
professors of criticism will teach you! Would
you know whether the tendency of a book is
good or evil, examine in what state of mind
you lay it down. Has it induced you to suspect
that what you have been accustomed to
think unlawful may after all be innocent, and
that may be harmless which you have hitherto
been taught to think dangerous? Has it
tended to make you dissatisfied and impatient
under the control of others, and disposed
you to relax in that self-government
without which both the laws of God and man
tell us there can be no virtue, and, consequently,
no happiness? Has it attempted to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>abate your admiration and reverence for what
is great and good, and to diminish in you the
love of your country and your fellow-creatures?
Has it addressed itself to your pride,
your vanity, your selfishness, or any other of
your evil propensities? Has it defiled the imagination
with what is loathsome, and shocked
the heart with what is monstrous? Has it
disturbed the sense of right and wrong which
the Creator has implanted in the human soul?
If so, if you are conscious of any or all of
these effects, or if, having escaped from all,
you have felt that such were the effects it was
intended to produce, throw the book in the
fire, whatever name it may bear in the titlepage!
Throw it in the fire, young man,
though it should have been the gift of a
friend; young lady, away with the whole set,
though it should be the prominent furniture
of a rosewood bookcase.”<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>“It is the case with literature as with life,”
says Arthur Schopenhauer, the German philosopher.
“Wherever we turn we come upon
the incorrigible mob of humankind, whose
name is Legion, swarming everywhere, damaging
everything, as flies in summer. Hence
the multiplicity of bad books, those exuberant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>weeds of literature which choke the true corn.
Such books rob the public of time, money,
and attention, which ought properly to belong
to good literature and noble aims; and they
are written with a view merely to make money
or occupation. They are therefore not merely
useless, but injurious. Nine tenths of our
current literature has no other end but to inveigle
a thaler or two out of the public pocket,
for which purpose author, publisher, and
printer are leagued together.... Of bad
books we can never read too little; of the
good, never too much. The bad are intellectual
poison, and undermine the understanding.”<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>From Thomas Carlyle’s inaugural address at
Edinburgh on the occasion of his installation
as rector of the University in 1866, I quote
the following potent passage: “I do not know
whether it has been sufficiently brought home
to you that there are two kinds of books.
When a man is reading on any kind of subject,
in most departments of books,&mdash;in all books,
if you take it in a wide sense,&mdash;he will find
that there is a division into good books and
bad books: everywhere a good kind of a book
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>and a bad kind of a book. I am not to assume
that you are unacquainted or ill-acquainted
with this plain fact; but I may remind you
that it is becoming a very important consideration
in our day.... There is a number,
a frightfully increasing number, of books that
are decidedly, to the readers of them, not
useful. But an ingenious reader will learn,
also, that a certain number of books were
written by a supremely noble kind of people;
not a very great number of books, but still a
number fit to occupy all your reading industry,
do adhere more or less to that side of
things. In short, as I have written it down
somewhere else, I conceive that books are
like men’s souls, divided into sheep and goats.
Some few are going up, and carrying us up,
heavenward; calculated, I mean, to be of
priceless advantage in teaching,&mdash;in forwarding
the teaching of all generations. Others,
a frightful multitude, are going down, down;
doing ever the more and the wider and the
wilder mischief. Keep a strict eye on that
latter class of books, my young friends!”</p>

<p>Speaking of those books whose inward character
and influence it is hard at first to discern,
John Ruskin says: “Avoid especially
that class of literature which has a knowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
tone; it is the most poisonous of all. Every
good book, or piece of book, is full of admiration
and awe: it may contain firm assertion
or stern satire, but it never sneers coldly, nor
asserts haughtily; and it always leads you to
reverence or love something with your whole
heart. It is not always easy to distinguish
the satire of the venomous race of books from
the satire of the noble and pure ones; but,
in general, you may notice that the cold-blooded
Crustacean and Batrachian books will
sneer at sentiment, and the warm-blooded, human
books at sin.... Much of the literature
of the present day, though good to be read by
persons of ripe age, has a tendency to agitate
rather than confirm, and leaves its readers too
frequently in a helpless or hopeless indignation,
the worst possible state into which the
mind of youth can be thrown. It may, indeed,
become necessary for you, as you
advance in life, to set your hand to things
that need to be altered in the world, or apply
your heart chiefly to what must be pitied in
it, or condemned; but for a young person
the safest temper is one of reverence, and
the safest place one of obscurity. Certainly
at present, and perhaps through all your life,
your teachers are wisest when they make you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
content in quiet virtue; and that literature
and art are best for you which point out, in
common life and familiar things, the objects
for hopeful labor and for humble love.”<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>There would be fewer bad books in the
world if readers were properly informed and
warned of their character; and we may believe
that the really vicious books would
soon cease to exist if their makers and publishers
were popularly regarded with the same
detestation as other corrupters of the public
morals. “He who has published an injurious
book,” says Robert South, “sins, as
it were in his very grave; corrupts others
while he is rotting himself.” Addison says
much the same thing: “Writers of great
talents, who employ their parts in propagating
immorality, and seasoning vicious sentiments
with wit and humor, are to be looked upon
as the pests of society and the enemies of
mankind. They leave books behind them to
scatter infection and destroy their posterity.
They act the counterparts of a Confucius or
a Socrates, and seem to have been sent into
the world to deprave human nature, and sink
it into the condition of brutality.”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<p>And William Cobbett is still more severe
in his denunciation. In his “Advice to Young
Men,” he says: “I hope that your taste will
keep you aloof from the writings of those
detestable villains who employ the powers of
their mind in debauching the minds of others,
or in endeavors to do it. They present their
poison in such captivating forms that it requires
great virtue and resolution to withstand
their temptations; and they have, perhaps,
done a thousand times as much mischief in
the world as all the infidels and atheists put
together. These men ought to be held in
universal abhorrence, and never spoken of
but with execration.”</p>

<p>But the shunning of bad books is only one
of the problems presented to us in the choice
of our reading. In the great multitude of
really good and valuable books, how shall we
choose those which are of the most vital importance
to us to know? The universal habit
of desultory reading&mdash;reading simply to be
entertained&mdash;is a habit not to be indulged
in, nor encouraged, by scholars or by those
who aspire to the station of teachers. There
are perhaps a score of books which should
be read and studied by every one who claims
the title of reader; but, aside from these, each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
person should determine, through a process of
rigid self-examination, what course of reading
and what books are likely to produce the most
profitable results to him. Find out, if possible,
what is your special bent of mind. What
line of inquiry or investigation is the most
congenial to your taste or mental capacity?
Having determined this question, let your
reading all centre upon that topic of study
which you have made your own,&mdash;let it be
Literature, Science, History, Art, or any of
the innumerable subdivisions of these subjects.
In other words, choose a specialty, and
follow it with an eye single to it alone.</p>

<p>Says Frederic Harrison: “Every book that
we take up without a purpose is an opportunity
lost of taking up a book with a purpose;
every bit of stray information which we
cram into our heads without any sense of its
importance is for the most part a bit of the
most useful information driven out of our
heads and choked off from our minds....
We know that books differ in value as much
as diamonds differ from the sand on the sea-shore,
as much as our living friend differs
from a dead rat. We know that much in the
myriad-peopled world of books&mdash;very much
in all kinds&mdash;is trivial, enervating, inane, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
noxious. And thus, where we have infinite
opportunities of wasting our effort to no end,
of fatiguing our minds without enriching them,
of clogging the spirit without satisfying it,
there, I cannot but think, the very infinity of
opportunities is robbing us of the actual power
of using them.... To know anything that
turns up is, in the infinity of knowledge, to
know nothing. To read the first book we
come across, in the wilderness of books, is to
learn nothing. To turn over the pages of
ten thousand volumes is to be practically
indifferent to all that is good.”<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>“It is of paramount importance,” says
Schopenhauer, “to acquire the art <i>not</i> to read;
in other words, of not reading such books as
occupy the public mind, or even those which
make a noise in the world, and reach several
editions in their first and last year of existence.
We should recollect that he who writes for
fools finds an enormous audience, and we
should devote the ever scant leisure of our circumscribed
existence to the master-spirits of all
ages and nations, those who tower over humanity,
and whom the voice of Fame proclaims:
only such writers cultivate and instruct us.”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>And John Ruskin offers the following pertinent
advice to beginners: “It is of the
greatest importance to you, not only for art’s
sake, but for all kinds of sake, in these days
of book deluge, to keep out of the salt
swamps of literature, and live on a little rocky
island of your own, with a spring and a lake
in it, pure and good. I cannot, of course,
suggest the choice of your library to you, for
every several mind needs different books;
but there are some books which we all need,
and assuredly, if you read Homer, Plato,
Æschylus, Herodotus, Dante, Shakspeare,
and Spenser as much as you ought, you will
not require wide enlargement of your shelves
to right and left of them for purposes of perpetual
study. Among modern books, avoid
generally magazine and review literature.
Sometimes it may contain a useful abridgment
or a wholesome piece of criticism; but
the chances are ten to one it will either waste
your time or mislead you. If you want to
understand any subject whatever, read the
best book upon it you can hear of; not a
review of the book.... A common book will
often give you much amusement, but it is
only a noble book which will give you dear
friends.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<p>If any of us could recall the time which we
have spent in desultory and profitless reading,
and devote it now faithfully to the prosecution
of that special line of study which ought, long
ago, to have been chosen, how largely we
might add to our fund of useful knowledge,
and how grandly we might increase our intellectual
stature! “And again,” remarks
James Herbert Morse, “if I could recover the
hours idly given to the newspaper, not for
my own gratification, but solely for my neighbor
at the breakfast-table, I could compass
a solid course of English and American history,
get at the antecedents of political parties
in the two countries, and give the reasons for
the existence of Gladstone and Parnell, of
Blaine and Edmunds, in modern politics&mdash;and
there is undoubtedly a reason for them
all. Two columns a day in the newspapers&mdash;which
I could easily have spared, for they
were given mainly to murder-trials and the
search for corpses, or to the romance of the
reporter concerning the same&mdash;have during
the last ten years absorbed just about the
time I might have spent in reading a very respectable
course in history,&mdash;one embracing,
say, Curtius and Grote for Greece, Mommsen,
Merivale, and Gibbon for Rome, Macaulay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
and Green for my roots in Saxondom, Bancroft,
Hildreth, and Palfrey for the ancestral
tree in America, together with a very notable
excursion into Spain and Holland with Motley
and Prescott,&mdash;a course which I consider
very desirable, and one which should set up
a man of middle age very fairly in historical
knowledge. I am sure I could have saved
this amount out of any ten years of my newspaper
reading alone, without cutting off any
portion of that really valuable contribution for
which the daily paper is to be honored, and
which would be needed to make me an intelligent
man in the history of my own times.”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>It is not necessary that, in selecting a library
or in choosing what you will read, you should
have many books at your disposal. A few
books, well chosen and carefully read, will be
of infinitely more value to you than any miscellaneous
collection, however large. It is
possible for “the man of one book” to be
better equipped in knowledge and literary
attainments than he whose shelves are loaded
with all the fashionable literature of the day.
If your means will not permit you the luxury
of a library, buy one book, or a few books,
chosen with special reference to the line of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>reading which you have determined upon.
Let no honey-mouthed book-agent persuade
you to buy of his wares, unless they bear exactly
upon your specialty. You cannot afford
to waste money on mere catchpenny or machine
publications, whose only recommendation
is that they are harmless and that they sell
well. That man is to be envied who can say,
“I have a library of fifty or of a hundred
volumes, all relating to my chosen line of
thought, and not a single inferior or worthless
volume among them.”</p>

<p>I have before me a list of books,&mdash;“books
fashioned by the intellect of godlike men,”&mdash;books
which every person who aspires to
the rank of teacher or scholar should regard
as his inheritance from the master-minds of
the ages. If you know these books&mdash;or
some of them&mdash;you know much of that
which is best in the great world of letters.
You cannot afford to live in ignorance of
them.</p>

When you have the opportunity to
make the acquaintance of such as these, will
you waste your time with writers whom you
would be ashamed to number among your
personal friends? “Will you go and gossip
with your housemaid or your stable boy,
when you may talk with kings and queens,

by your own fault; by your aristocracy of
companionship there, your inherent aristocracy
will be assuredly tested, and the motives

the truth and sincerity that are in them, by
the place you desire to take in this company
of the dead.”<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a><br /><br /></p>

<img src="images/h.png" width="80" height="76" alt="H" /></span>AVING chosen the books which are
to be our friends and counsellors,
the next question to be considered
is, How shall we use them? Shall
we read them through as hastily as possible,
believing that the more we read, the more
learned we are? Or shall we not derive more
profit by reading slowly, and by making the
subject-matter of each book <i>thoroughly our
own</i>? I do not believe that any general rule<span class="pagenum padl2"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
can be given with reference to this matter.
Some readers will take in a page at a glance,
and will more thoroughly master a book in
a week than others could possibly master it
in six months. It required Frederick W.
Robertson half a year to read a small manual
of chemistry, and thoroughly to digest its contents.
Miss Martineau and Auguste Comte
were remarkably slow readers; but then, that
which they read “lay fructifying, and came
out a living tree with leaves and fruit.” Yet
it does not follow that the same rule should
apply to readers of every grade of genius.</p>

<p>It is generally better to read by subjects, to
learn what different writers have thought and
said concerning that matter of which you are
making a special study. Not many books are
to be read hastily through. “A person who
was a very great reader and hard thinker,”
says Bishop Thirlwall, “once told me that he
never took up a book except with the view of
making himself master of some subject which
he was studying, and that while he was so
engaged he made all his reading converge
to that point. In this way he might read
parts of many books, but not a single one
from ‘end to end.’ This I take to be an
excellent method of study, but one which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
implies the command of many books as well
as of much leisure.”</p>

<p>Seneca, the old Roman teacher, says: “Definite
reading is profitable; miscellaneous reading
is pleasant.... The reading of many
authors and of all kinds of works has in it
something vague and unstable.”</p>

<p>Says Quintilian: “Every good writer is to
be read, and diligently; and when the volume
is finished, it is to be gone through again
from the beginning.”</p>

<p>Martin Luther, in his “Table Talk,” says:
“All who would study with advantage in any
art whatsoever ought to betake themselves to
the reading of some sure and certain books
oftentimes over; for to read many books
produceth confusion rather than learning, like
as those who dwell everywhere are not anywhere
at home.”</p>

<p>“Reading,” says Locke the philosopher,
“furnishes the mind only with materials of
knowledge; it is thinking that makes what
are read over. We are of the ruminating
kind, and it is not enough to cram ourselves
with a great load of collections; unless we
chew them over again, they will not give us
strength and nourishment.”</p>

<p>“Much reading,” says Dr. Robert South,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
“is like much eating,&mdash;wholly useless without
digestion.”</p>

<p>“Desultory reading,” writes Julius C. Hare,
“is indeed very mischievous, by fostering
habits of loose, discontinuous thought, by
turning the memory into a common sewer for
rubbish of all thoughts to flow through, and
by relaxing the power of attention, which of
all our faculties most needs care, and is most
improved by it. But a well-regulated course
of study will no more weaken the mind than
hard exercise will weaken the body; nor will
a strong understanding be weighed down by
its knowledge, any more than oak is by its
leaves or than Samson was by his locks. He
whose sinews are drained by his hair must
already be a weakling.”<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>Says Thomas Carlyle: “Learn to be good
readers,&mdash;which is perhaps a more difficult
thing than you imagine. Learn to be discriminative
in your reading; to read faithfully,
and with your best attention, all kinds
of things which you have a real interest in,&mdash;a
real, not an imaginary,&mdash;and which you
find to be really fit for what you are engaged in.
The most unhappy of all men is the man who
cannot tell what he is going to do, who has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>got no work cut out for him in the world,
and does not go into it. For work is the
grand cure of all the maladies and miseries
that ever beset mankind,&mdash;honest work,
which you intend getting done.”</p>

<p>Says Ralph Waldo Emerson: “The best
rule of reading will be a method from nature,
and not a mechanical one of hours and pages.
It holds each student to a pursuit of his native
aim, instead of a desultory miscellany.
Let him read what is proper to him, and not
waste his memory on a crowd of mediocrities.
... The three practical rules which I have
to offer are: 1. Never read any book that is
not a year old. 2. Never read any but famed
books. 3. Never read any but what you like;
or, in Shakspeare’s phrase,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">‘No profit goes where is no pleasure ta’en:</div>
<div class="line">In brief, sir, study what you most affect.’”<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Let us read good works often over,” says
another writer.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> “Some skip from volume to
volume, touching on all points, resting on
none. We hold, on the contrary, that if a
book be worth reading once, it is worth reading
twice, and that if it stands a second
reading, it may stand a third. This, indeed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>is one great test of the excellence of books.
Many books require to be read more than
once, in order to be seen in their proper
colors and latent glories, and dim-discovered
truths will by-and-by disclose themselves....
Again, let us read thoughtfully; this is a great
secret in the right use of books. Not lazily,
to mumble, like the dogs in the siege of
Corinth, as dead bones, the words of the
author,&mdash;not slavishly to assent to his every
word, and cry Amen to his every conclusion,&mdash;not
to read him as an officer his general’s
orders, but to read him with suspicion, with
inquiry, with a free exercise of your own
faculties, with the admiration of intelligence,
and not with the wonder of ignorance,&mdash;that
is the proper and profitable way of reading
the great authors of your native tongue.”</p>

<p>Says Sir Arthur Helps: “There is another
view of reading which, though it is obvious
enough, is seldom taken, I imagine, or at
least acted upon; and that is, that in the
course of our reading we should lay up in
our minds a store of goodly thoughts in well-wrought
words, which should be a living
treasure of knowledge always with us, and
from which, at various times and amidst all
the shifting of circumstances, we might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
sure of drawing some comfort, guidance, and
sympathy.... In any work that is worth
carefully reading, there is generally something
that is worth remembering accurately. A
man whose mind is enriched with the best
sayings of his own country is a more independent
man, walks the streets in a town or the
lanes in the country with far more delight
than he otherwise would have, and is taught
by wise observers of man and nature to
examine for himself. Sancho Panza, with his
proverbs, is a great deal better than he would
have been without them; and I contend that
a man has something in himself to meet
troubles and difficulties, small or great, who
has stored in his mind some of the best things
which have been said about troubles and
difficulties.”<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>And John Ruskin: “No book is worth
anything which is not worth <i>much</i>; nor is it
serviceable until it has been read, and reread,
and loved, and loved again; and
marked, so that you can refer to the passages
you want in it, as a soldier can seize the
weapons he needs in an armory, or a housewife
bring the spice she needs from her
store.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>
<p>“I am not at all afraid,” says Matthew
Browne, “of urging overmuch the propriety
of frequent, very frequent, reading of the
same book. The book remains the same,
but the reader changes; and the value of
reading lies in the collision of minds. It may
be taken for granted that <i>no</i> conceivable
amount of reading could ever put me into the
position with respect to his book&mdash;I mean
as to intelligence only&mdash;in which the author
strove to place me. I may read him a hundred
times, and not catch the precise right
point of view; and may read him a hundred
and one times, and approach it the hundred
and first. The driest and hardest book that
ever was, contains an interest over and above
what can be picked out of it, and laid, so to
speak, on the table. It is interesting as my
friend is interesting; it is a problem which
invites me to closer knowledge, and <i>that</i>
usually means better liking. He must be a
poor friend that we only care to see once or
twice, and then forget.”<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>“The great secret of reading consists in
this,” says Charles F. Richardson, “that it
does not matter so much what we read, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>how we read it, as what we think and how we
think it. Reading is only the fuel; and, the
mind once on fire, any and all material will
feed the flame, provided only it have any
combustible matter in it. And we cannot
tell from what quarter the next material will
come. The thought we need, the facts we
are in search of, may make their appearance
in the corner of the newspaper, or in some
forgotten volume long ago consigned to dust
and oblivion.... The mind that is not
awake and alive will find a library a barren
wilderness. Now, gather up the scraps and
fragments of thought on whatever subject
you may be studying,&mdash;for of course by a
note-book I do not mean a mere receptacle
for odds and ends, a literary dust-bin,&mdash;but
acquire the habit of gathering everything
whenever and wherever you find it, that belongs
in your line or lines of study, and you
will be surprised to see how such fragments
will arrange themselves into an orderly whole
by the very organizing power of your own
thinking, acting in a definite direction. This
is a true process of self-education; but you
see it is no mechanical process of mere aggregation.
It requires activity of thought;
but without that, what is any reading but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
mere passive amusement? And it requires
method. I have myself a sort of literary
book-keeping. I post my literary accounts,
bringing together in proper groups the fruits
of much casual reading.”<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>Edward Gibbon the historian tells us that
a taste for books was the pleasure and glory
of his life. “Let us read with method,” he
says, “and propose to ourselves an end to
what our studies may point. The use of
reading is to aid us in thinking.”</p>

<p>Among practical suggestions to those who
would read for profit, I have found nothing
more pertinent than the following from the
posthumous papers of Bryan Waller Procter:
“Always read the preface to a book. It
places you on vantage ground, and enables
you to survey more completely the book itself.
You frequently also discover the character
of the author from the preface. You
see his aims, perhaps his prejudices. You
see the point of view from which he takes
his pictures, the rocks and impediments
which he himself beholds, and you steer accordingly....
Understand every word you
read; if possible, every allusion of the author,&mdash;if
practicable, while you are reading;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>if not, make search and inquiry as soon as
may be afterward. Have a dictionary near
you when you read; and when you read a
book of travels, always read with a map of
the country at hand. Without a map the information
is vague and transitory.... After
having read as much as your mind will
easily retain, sum up what you have read,&mdash;endeavor
to place in view the portion or subject
that has formed your morning’s study;
and then reckon up (as you would reckon
up a sum) the facts or items of knowledge
that you have gained. It generally happens
that the amount of three or four hours’ reading
may be reduced to and concentrated in
half a dozen propositions. These are your
gains,&mdash;these are the facts or opinions that
you have acquired. You may investigate
the truth of them hereafter. Although I
think that one’s general reading should extend
over many subjects, yet for serious
<i>study</i> we should confine ourselves to some
branch of literature or science. Otherwise
the mind becomes confused and enfeebled,
and the thoughts, dissipated on many things,
will settle profitably on none. A man whose
duration of life is limited, and whose powers
are limited also, should not aim at all things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
but should content himself with a few. By
such means he may master one, and become
tolerably familiar perhaps with two or three
arts or sciences. He may indeed even make
valuable contributions to them. Without
this economy of labor, he cannot produce
any complete work, nor can he exhaust any
subject.”<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>Every scholar is familiar with Lord Bacon’s
classification of books,&mdash;some “to be tasted,
others to be swallowed, and some few to be
chewed and digested: that is, some books
are to be read only in parts; others to be
read, but not curiously; and some few to
be read wholly, and with diligence and
attention.” Coleridge’s classification of the
various kinds of readers is perhaps not quite
so well known. He said that some readers
are like jelly-bags,&mdash;they let pass away all
that is pure and good, and retain only what
is impure and refuse. Another class he typified
by a sponge; these are they whose
minds suck all up, and give it back again,
only a little dirtier. Others, again, he likened
to an hour-glass, and their reading to the sand
which runs in and out, and leaves no trace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>behind. And still others he compared to the
slave in the Golconda mines, who retains the
gold and the gem, and casts aside the dust
and the dross. Charles C. Colton, the author
of “Lacon,” says there are three kinds of readers:
first, those who read to think,&mdash;and they
are rare; second, those who read to write,&mdash;and
they are common; third, those who read
to talk,&mdash;and they form the great majority.
And Goethe, the greatest name in German
literature, makes still a different classification:
some readers, he tells us, enjoy without judgment;
others judge without enjoyment; and
some there are who judge while they enjoy,
and enjoy while they judge.</p>

<p>In these days, when, so far as reading-matter
is concerned, we are overburdened
with an embarrassment of riches, we cannot
afford to read, even in the books which we
have chosen as ours, those things which have
no relationship to our studies, which do not
concern us, and which are sure to be forgotten
as soon as read. The art of reading, says
Philip Gilbert Hamerton in his admirable
essay on “The Intellectual Life,” “is to skip
judiciously. The art is to skip all that does
not concern us, whilst missing nothing that
we really need. No external guidance can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
teach this; for nobody but ourselves can
guess what the needs of our intellect may be.
But let us select with decisive firmness, independently
of other people’s advice, independently
of the authority of custom.” And
Charles F. Richardson, referring to the same
subject, remarks: “The art of skipping is,
in a word, the art of noting and shunning that
which is bad, or frivolous, or misleading, or
unsuitable for one’s individual needs. If you
are convinced that the book or the chapter is
bad, you cannot drop it too quickly. If it is
simply idle and foolish, put it away on that
account,&mdash;unless you are properly seeking
amusement from idleness and frivolity. If it
is something deceitful and disingenuous, your
task is not so easy; but your conscience will
give you warning, and the sharp examination
which should follow will tell you that you are
in poor literary company.”<br /><br /></p>

<img src="images/a.png" width="80" height="78" alt="A" /></span> LIBRARY is the scholar’s workshop.
To the teacher or professional
man, a collection of good
books is as necessary as a kit of
tools to a carpenter. And yet I am aware
that many persons are engaged in teaching,<span class="pagenum padl2"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
who have neither a library of their own, nor
access to any other collection of books suitable
to their use. There are others who,
having every opportunity to secure the best
of books,&mdash;with a public library near at hand
offering them the free use of works most valuable
to them,&mdash;yet make no effort to profit
by these advantages. They care nothing for
any books save the text-books indispensable
to their profession, and for these only so far
as necessity obliges them to do so. The
libraries of many persons calling themselves
teachers consist solely of school-books, many
of which have been presented them by accommodating
book-agents, “for examination with
a view to introduction.” And yet we hear
such teachers talk learnedly about the introduction
of English literature into the common
schools of the country, and the necessity of
cultivating among the children a wholesome
love and taste for reading. If inquiry were
made, we might discover that by a study of
English literature these teachers understand
some memoriter exercises in Shaw’s “Manual”
or Brooke’s “Primer,” and that, as to good
reading, some there are who are entertained
more deeply by Peck’s “Bad Boy” than by
Shakspeare’s “Merchant of Venice.” Talk not<span class="pagenum padl2"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
about directing and cultivating the reading-tastes
of your pupils until you have successfully
directed and cultivated your own! And the
first step towards doing this is the selection
and purchase of a library for yourself, which
shall be all your own. A very few books will
do, if they are of the right kind; and they
must be <i>yours</i>. A borrowed book is but a
cheap pleasure, an unappreciated and unsatisfactory
tool. To know the true value of
books, and to derive any satisfactory benefit
from them, you must first feel the sweet delight
of buying them,&mdash;you must know the
preciousness of possession.</p>

<p>You plead poverty,&mdash;the insufficiency of
your salary? But do you not spend for other
things, entirely unnecessary, much more every
year than the cost of a few books? The immediate
outlay need not be large, the returns
which you will realize will be great in proportion
to your good judgment and earnestness.
Not only will the possession of a good
library add to your means of enjoyment and
increase your capacity for doing good, it may,
if you are worldly-minded,&mdash;and we all are,&mdash;put
you in the way of occupying a more
desirable position and earning a more satisfactory
reward for your labors.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of books that you
will need in your library: first, those which
are purely professional, and are in the strictest
sense the tools of your craft; second, those
which belong to your chosen department of
literature, and are to be regarded as your
friends, companions, and counsellors. I cannot,
of course, dictate to you what these
books shall be. The lists given in the chapters
which follow this are designed simply as
suggestive aids. But in a library of fifty or
even thirty well-chosen volumes you may
possess infinite riches, and means for a lifetime
of enjoyment; while, on the other hand,
if your selection is injudicious, you may expend
thousands of dollars for a collection of
the odds and ends of literature, which will be
only an incumbrance and a hindrance to you.</p>

<p>“I would urge upon every young man, as
the beginning of his due and wise provision
for his household,” says John Ruskin, “to
obtain as soon as he can, by the severest
economy, a restricted, serviceable, and steadily&mdash;however
slowly&mdash;increasing series of
books for use through life; making his little
library, of all the furniture in his room, the
most studied and decorative piece; every
volume having its assigned place, like a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
statue in its niche, and one of the earliest and
strictest lessons to the children of the house
being how to turn the pages of their own
literary possessions lightly and deliberately,
with no chance of tearing or dog’s-ears.”<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>And Henry Ward Beecher emphasizes the
same thing, remarking that, among the early
ambitions to be excited in clerks, workmen,
journeymen, and indeed among all that are
struggling up in life from nothing to something,
the most important is that of forming and
continually adding to a library of good books.
“A little library, growing larger every year, is
an honorable part of a man’s history. It is
a man’s duty to have books. A library is not
a luxury, but one of the necessaries of life.”</p>

<p>“How much do you think we spend altogether
on our libraries, public or private, as
compared with what we spend on our horses?”
asks another enthusiastic lover of books, already
quoted. “If a man spends lavishly on
his library, you call him mad,&mdash;a bibliomaniac.
But you never call any one a horse-maniac,
though men ruin themselves every
day by their horses, and you do not hear of
people ruining themselves by their books....
We talk of food for the mind, as of food for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>the body: now, a good book contains such
food inexhaustibly; it is a provision for life,
and for the best of us; yet how long most
people would look at the best book before
they would give the price of a large turbot
for it! Though there have been men who
have pinched their stomachs and bared their
backs to buy a book, whose libraries were
cheaper to them, I think, in the end than
most men’s dinners are. We are few of us
put to such trial, and more the pity: for,
indeed, a precious thing is all the more precious
to us if it has been won by work or
economy; and if public libraries were half as
costly as public dinners, or books cost the
tenth part of what bracelets do, even foolish
men and women might sometimes suspect
there was good in reading, as well as in
munching and sparkling; whereas the very
cheapness of literature is making even wise
people forget that if a book is worth reading,
it is worth buying.”</p>

<p>“The truest owner of a library,” says the author
of “Hesperides,” “is he who has bought
each book for the love he bears to it,&mdash;who
is happy and content to say, ‘Here are my
jewels, my choicest material possessions!’&mdash;who
is proud to crown such assertion thus:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
‘I am content that this library shall represent
the use of the talents given me by
Heaven!’ That man’s library, though not
commensurate with his love for books, will
demonstrate what he has been able to accomplish
with his resources; it will denote
economy of living, eagerness to possess the
particles that compose his library, and quick
watchfulness to seize them when means and
opportunities serve. Such a man has built
a temple, of which each brick has been the
subject of curious and acute intelligent examination
and appreciation before it has been
placed in the sacred building.”</p>

<p>“Every man should have a library!”
exclaims William Axon. “The works of the
grandest masters of literature may now be
procured at prices that place them within the
reach almost of the very poorest, and we
may all put Parnassian singing-birds into our
chambers to cheer us with the sweetness of
their songs. And when we have got our little
library we may look proudly at Shakspeare
and Bacon and Bunyan, as they stand in our
bookcase with other noble spirits, and one or
two of whom the world knows nothing, but
whose worth we have often tested. These
may cheer and enlighten us, may inspire us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
with higher aims and aspirations, may make
us, if we use them rightly, wiser and better
men.”<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>Good old George Dyer, the friend of the
poet Southey, as learned as he was benevolent,
was wont to say: “Libraries are the
wardrobes of literature, whence men, properly
informed, may bring forth something for ornament,
much for curiosity, and more for
use.” “Any library is an attraction,” says the
venerable A. Bronson Alcott; and Victor
Hugo writes&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i05">“A library implies an act of faith,</div>
<div class="line">Which generations still in darkness hid</div>
<div class="line">Sign in their night in witness of the dawn.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>John Bright, the great English statesman
and reformer, in a speech at the opening of
the Birmingham Free Library a short time
ago, remarked: “You may have in a house
costly pictures and costly ornaments, and a
great variety of decoration; yet, so far as my
judgment goes, I would prefer to have one
comfortable room well stocked with books to
all you can give me in the way of decoration
which the highest art can supply. The only
subject of lamentation is&mdash;one feels that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>always, I think, in the presence of a library&mdash;that
life is too short, and I am afraid I must
say also that our industry is so far deficient
that we seem to have no hope of a full enjoyment
of the ample repast that is spread
before us. In the houses of the humble a
little library, in my opinion, is a most precious
possession.”</p>

<p>Jean Paul Richter, it is said, was always
melancholy in a large library, because it reminded
him of his ignorance.</p>

<p>“A library may be regarded as the solemn
chamber in which a man can take counsel of
all that have been wise and great and good
and glorious amongst the men that have gone
before him,” said George Dawson, also at
Birmingham. “If we come down for a moment
and look at the bare and immediate
utilities of a library, we find that here a man
gets himself ready for his calling, arms himself
for his profession, finds out the facts that
are to determine his trade, prepares himself
for his examination. The utilities of it are
endless and priceless. It is, too, a place of
pastime; for man has no amusement more
innocent, more sweet, more gracious, more
elevating, and more fortifying than he can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>find in a library. If he be fond of books,
his fondness will discipline him as well as
amuse him.... A library is the strengthener
of all that is great in life, and the repeller of
what is petty and mean; and half the gossip
of society would perish if the books that are
truly worth reading were read.... When we
look through the houses of a large part of the
middle classes of this country, we find there
everything but what there ought most to be.
There are no books in them worth talking of.
If a question arises of geography, they have no
atlases. If the question be when a great man
was born, they cannot help you. They can
give you a gorgeous bed, with four posts,
marvellous adornments, luxurious hangings,
and lacquered shams all round; they can
give you dinners <i>ad nauseam</i>, and wine that
one can, or cannot, honestly praise. But useful
books are almost the last things that are to
be found there; and when the mind is empty
of those things that books can alone fill it
with, then the seven devils of pettiness, frivolity,
fashionableness, gentility, scandal, small
slander, and the chronicling of small beer
come in and take possession. Half this
nonsense would be dropped if men would
only understand the elevating influences of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>their communing constantly with the lofty
thoughts and high resolves of men of old
times.”</p>

<p>The author of “Dreamthorpe,” filled with
love and enthusiasm, discourses thus: “I go
into my library, and all history unrolls before
me. I breathe the morning air of the world
while the scent of Eden’s roses yet lingers in
it, while it vibrates only to the world’s first
brood of nightingales and to the laugh of
Eve. I see the pyramids building; I hear
the shoutings of the armies of Alexander; I
feel the ground shake beneath the march of
Cambyses. I sit as in a theatre,&mdash;the stage
is time; the play is the play of the world.
What a spectacle it is! What kingly pomp,
what processions file past, what cities burn to
heaven, what crowds of captives are dragged
at the chariot wheels of conquerors! I hiss,
or cry ‘Bravo,’ when the great actors come
on, shaking the stage. I am a Roman emperor
when I look at a Roman coin. I lift
Homer, and I shout with Achilles in the
trenches. The silence of the unpeopled Assyrian
plains, the out-comings and in-goings of
the patriarchs,&mdash;Abraham and Ishmael, Isaac
in the fields at eventide, Rebekah at the well,
Jacob’s guile, Esau’s face reddened by desert
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>sun-heat, Joseph’s splendid funeral procession,
&mdash;all these things I find within the boards of
my Old Testament. What a silence in those
old books as of a half-peopled world,&mdash;what
bleating of flocks, what green pastoral rest,
what indubitable human existence! Across
brawling centuries of blood and war, I hear
the bleating of Abraham’s flocks, the tinkling
of the bells of Rebekah’s camels. O men
and women, so far separated yet so near, so
strange yet so well-known, by what miraculous
power do I know you all? Books are the true
Elysian fields, where the spirits of the dead
converse; and into these fields a mortal may
venture unappalled. What king’s court can
boast such company? What school of philosophy,
such wisdom? The wit of the ancient
world is glancing and flashing there.
There is Pan’s pipe, there are the songs of
Apollo. Seated in my library at night, and
looking on the silent faces of my books, I am
occasionally visited by a strange sense of the
supernatural. They are not collections of
printed pages, they are ghosts. I take one
down, and it speaks with me in a tongue not
now heard on earth, and of men and things
of which it alone possesses knowledge. I
call myself a solitary, but sometimes I think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>I misapply the term. No man sees more
company than I do. I travel with mightier
cohorts around me than did ever Timour or
Genghis Khan on their fiery marches. I am
a sovereign in my library; but it is the dead,
not the living, that attend my levees.”<br /><br /></p>

<img src="images/t.png" width="80" height="81" alt="T" /></span>O assist teachers and scholars, and
those who aspire to become such,
in making judicious selection of
world-famous books for their libraries,
I submit the following list, which includes
the greater part of all that is the very best and
the most enduring in our language. It is not
intended to embrace professional works, nor
works suited merely for students of specialties.
The books named are such as will grace the
library of any scholar, no matter what his
profession or his preferences; they are books
which every teacher ought to know; they are
<span class="pagenum padl2"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
books of which no one can ever feel ashamed.
“The first thing naturally, when one enters
a scholar’s study or library,” says Holmes, “is
to look at his books. One gets a notion very
speedily of his tastes and the range of his
pursuits by a glance round his book-shelves.”
And, take my word for it, if you want a library
of which you will be proud, you cannot be
too careful as to the character of the books
you put in it.</p>

<p class="center" style="page-break-before: always;">POETRY.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="indent">
<i>Chaucer’s Poetical Works</i>, or, if not the complete
works, at least the “Canterbury Tales.” In
speaking of the great works in English Poetry,
it is natural to mention Chaucer first, although,
as a general rule, he should be one of the last
read. “It is sufficient to say, according to the
proverb, that <i>here is God’s plenty</i>.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dryden.</span>
</p><p class="indent">
<i>Spenser’s Faerie Queene</i>, not to be read through, but
in selections. “We can scarcely comprehend
how a perusal of the Faerie Queene can fail to insure
to the true believer a succession of halcyon
days.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hazlitt.</span>
</p><p class="indent">
<i>The Works of William Shakspeare.</i> The following
editions of Shakspeare have been issued within

<i>John Webster’s Tragedies.</i> “To move a horror skilfully,
to touch a soul to the quick, to lay upon

<p>
In addition to the works named above,
there are several collections of short poems
and selections of poetry invaluable to the
student. They are “infinite riches in little
room.” I name&mdash;</p>

<p>“A large part of what is best worth knowing
in ancient literature, and in the literature
of France, Italy, Germany, and Spain,” says
Lord Macaulay, “has been translated into our
own tongue. I would not dissuade any person
from studying either the ancient languages
or the languages of modern Europe; but I
would console those who have not time to
make themselves linguists by assuring them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
that, by means of their own mother tongue,
they may obtain ready access to vast intellectual
treasures, to treasures such as might
have been envied by the greatest linguists of
the age of Charles the Fifth, to treasures surpassing
those which were possessed by Aldus,
by Erasmus, and by Melanchthon.”</p>

<p>I name some of the treasures which you
may thus acquire&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="indent"><i>Homer’s Iliad.</i> Of this work, without which no
scholar’s library is complete, many translations
have been made. The most notable are George
Chapman’s (1611), Pope’s (1715), Tickell’s (1715),
Cowper’s (1781), Lord Derby’s (1867), Bryant’s
(1870). Americans will, of course, prefer Bryant’s
translation; but Derby’s is more poetical, and
the greatest scholars award the palm of merit to
Chapman. Says Lowell: “Chapman has made
for us the best poem that has yet been Englished
out of Homer.”</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Æschylus.</i> “Prometheus Bound” has been rendered
into English verse by Elizabeth Barrett
Browning, “Agamemnon” has been translated
by Dean Milman, and the entire seven tragedies
by Dean Potter. “The ‘Prometheus’ is a poem
of the like dignity and scope as the Book of Job,
or the Norse Edda.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Emerson.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Aristophanes.</i> The translation by John Hookham
Frere is admirable. “We might apply to the
pieces of Aristophanes the motto of a pleasant
and acute adventurer in Goethe: ‘Mad, but
clever.’”&mdash;<span class="smcap">A. W. Schlegel.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Virgil’s Æneid.</i> The best known translations of
Virgil are Dryden’s (1697), Christopher Pitt’s<span class="pagenum padl3"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
(1740), John Conington’s (1870), William Morris’s
(1876). Your choice among these will lie
between the last two. “Virgil is far below Homer;
yet Virgil has genius enough to be two
men.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord Lytton.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Horace’s Odes, Epodes, and Satires.</i> There are excellent
translations by Conington, Lord Lytton,
and T. Martin. “There is Horace, charming
man of the world, who will condole with you
feelingly on the loss of your fortune, ... but
who will yet show you that a man may be happy
with a vile modicum or <i>parva rura</i>.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ibid.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Dante’s Divina Commedia.</i> Translated by Longfellow.
“The finest narrative poem of modern
times.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Macaulay.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Goethe’s Faust.</i> Translated by Bayard Taylor. “What
constitutes Goethe’s glory is, that in the nineteenth
century he did produce an epic poem&mdash;I
mean a poem in which genuine gods act and
speak.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">H. A. Taine.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Of the best poetry written in the modern
foreign tongues, you will have no difficulty
in finding excellent translations. There are
good English editions of Dante, Petrarch,
Ariosto, and Tasso; of Calderon and Camoens;
of Molière, Corneille, Racine, and
Victor Hugo; and of Goethe and Schiller.
And to make your collection complete for
all the purposes of a scholar, you will want
Longfellow’s “Poets and Poetry of Europe,”
containing translations of the best short poems
written in the modern European languages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<p>Of modern poetry, John Ruskin advises
beginners to “keep to Scott, Wordsworth,
Keats, Crabbe, Tennyson, the two Brownings,
Lowell, Longfellow, and Coventry Patmore,
whose ‘Angel in the House’ is a most finished
piece of writing, and the sweetest analysis we
possess of quiet modern domestic feeling....
Cast Coleridge at once aside as sickly and
useless; and Shelley as shallow and verbose;
Byron, until your taste is fully formed, and
you are able to discern the magnificence in
him from the wrong. Never read bad or
common poetry, nor write any poetry yourself;
there is, perhaps, rather too much than
too little in the world already.”</p>

<p>Says Frederic Harrison: “I am for the
school of all the great men; and I am against
the school of the smaller men. I care for
Wordsworth as well as for Byron, for Burns
as well as for Shelley, for Boccaccio as well as
for Milton, for Bunyan as well as Rabelais, for
Cervantes as much as for Dante, for Corneille
as well as for Shakspeare, for Goldsmith as
well as Goethe. I stand by the sentence of
the world; and I hold that in a matter so
human and so broad as the highest poetry,
the judgment of the nations of Europe is
pretty well settled.... The busy world may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
fairly reserve the lesser lights for the time
when it knows the greatest well.... Nor
shall we forget those wonderful idealizations
of awakening thought and primitive societies,
the pictures of other races and types of life
removed from our own: all those primeval
legends, ballads, songs, and tales, those proverbs,
apologues, and maxims which have come
down to us from distant ages of man’s history,&mdash;the
old idyls and myths of the Hebrew
race; the tales of Greece, of the Middle Ages,
of the East; the fables of the old and the
new world; the songs of the Nibelungs; the
romances of early feudalism; the ‘Morte
d’Arthur’; the ‘Arabian Nights;’ the ballads
of the early nations of Europe.”</p>

<p class="center" style="page-break-before: always;">PROSE.</p>

<p>In the following list I shall endeavor to
name only the truly great and time-abiding
books,&mdash;books to be used not simply as
tools, but for the “building up of a lofty character,”
the turning of the soul inward upon itself,
concentrating its forces, and fitting it for
greater and stronger achievements. They
embody the best thoughts of the best thinkers;
and almost any one of them, if properly read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
and “energized upon,” will furnish food for
study, and meditation, and mind-growth,
enough for the best of us.</p>

<p>This list might be readily extended; but I

<p>I close this chapter with Leigh Hunt’s
pleasant word-picture descriptive of his own
library: “Sitting last winter among my books,
and walled round with all the comfort and
protection which they and my fireside could
afford me,&mdash;to wit, a table of high-piled
books at my back, my writing-desk on one
side of me, some shelves on the other, and
the feeling of the warm fire at my feet,&mdash;I
began to consider how I loved the authors of
those books; how I loved them too, not only
for the imaginative pleasures they afforded
me, but for their making me love the very
books themselves, and delight to be in contact
with them. I looked sideways at my
Spenser, my Theocritus, and my Arabian
Nights; then above them at my Italian Poets;
then behind me at my Dryden and Pope, my
Romances, and my Boccaccio; then on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
my left side at my Chaucer, who lay on my
writing-desk; and thought how natural it was
in Charles Lamb to give a kiss to an old
folio, as I once saw him do to Chapman’s
Homer.... I entrench myself in my books,
equally against sorrow and the weather. If
the wind comes through a passage, I look
about to see how I can fence it off by a
better disposition of my movables; if a melancholy
thought is importunate, I give another
glance at my Spenser. When I speak
of being in contact with my books, I mean it
literally. I like to be able to lean my head
against them.... The very perusal of the
backs is a ‘discipline of humanity.’ There Mr.
Southey takes his place again with an old Radical
friend; there Jeremy Collier is at peace
with Dryden; there the lion, Martin Luther,
lies down with the Quaker lamb, Sewell;
there Guzman d’Alfarache thinks himself fit
company for Sir Charles Grandison, and has
his claims admitted.... Nothing, while I
live and think, can deprive me of my value
for such treasures. I can help the appreciation
of them while I last, and love them
till I die; and perhaps I may chance, some
quiet day, to lay my over-beating temples on
a book, and so have the death I most envy.”<br /><br /></p>

<p class="center"><b>What Books Shall Young Folks Read?</b></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/t.png" width="80" height="81" alt="T" /></span>HE greatest problem presented to
the consideration of parents and
teachers now-a-days is how properly
to regulate and direct the reading
of the children. There is no scarcity of
reading-matter. The poorest child may have
free access to books and papers, more than he
can read. The publication of periodicals and
cheap books especially designed to meet the
tastes of young people has developed into an
enterprise of vast proportions. Every day,
millions of pages of reading matter designed
for children are printed and scattered broadcast
over the land. But unlimited opportunities
often prove to be a damage and a
detriment; and over-abundance, rather than
scarcity, is to be deplored. As a general rule,<span class="pagenum padl2"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
the books read by young people are not such
as lead to studious habits, or induce correct
ideas of right living. They are intended
simply to amuse; there are no elements of
strength in them, leading up to a noble manhood.
I doubt if in the future it can be
said of any great statesman or scholar that
his tastes had been formed, and his energies
directed and sustained, through the influence
of his early reading; but rather that he had
attained success, and whatever of true nobility
there is in him, in spite of such
influence.</p>

<p>This was not always so. The experience
of a few well-known scholars will illustrate.
“From my infancy,” says Benjamin Franklin,
“I was passionately fond of reading, and all
the money that came into my hands was laid
out in the purchasing of books. I was very
fond of voyages. My first acquisition was
Bunyan’s works in separate little volumes. I
afterwards sold them to enable me to buy
R. Burton’s Historical Collections. They were
small chapmen’s books, and cheap; forty
volumes in all. My father’s little library consisted
chiefly of books in polemic divinity,
most of which I read. I have often regretted
that at a time when I had such a thirst for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
knowledge more proper books had not fallen
in my way, since it was resolved I should not
be bred to divinity. There was among them
Plutarch’s Lives, which I read abundantly,
and I still think the time spent to great advantage.
There was also a book of Defoe’s
called ‘An Essay on Projects,’ and another of
Dr. Mather’s, called ‘An Essay to Do Good,’
which perhaps gave me a turn of thinking
that had an influence on some of the principal
future events of my life. This bookish inclination
at length determined my father to
make me a printer.... I stood out some
time, but at last was persuaded, and signed
the indenture when I was yet but twelve
years old.... I now had access to better
books. An acquaintance with the apprentices
of booksellers enabled me sometimes to
borrow a small one, which I was careful to
return soon, and clean. Often I sat up in
my chamber the greatest part of the night,
when the book was borrowed in the evening
and to be returned in the morning, lest it
should be found missing.... About this
time I met with an odd volume of the ‘Spectator.’
I had never before seen any of them.
I bought it, read it over and over, and was
much delighted with it. I thought the writ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>ing
excellent, and wished if possible to imitate
it. With that view I took some of the
papers, and, making short hints of the sentiments
in each sentence, laid them by a few
days, and then, without looking at the book,
tried to complete the papers again, by expressing
each hinted sentiment at length, and
as fully as it had been expressed before, in
any suitable words that should occur to me.
Then I compared my ‘Spectator’ with the
original, discovered some of my faults, and
corrected them....</p>

<p>“Now it was, that, being on some occasions
made ashamed of my ignorance in figures,
which I had twice failed learning when at
school, I took Cocker’s book on Arithmetic,
and went through the whole by myself with
the greatest ease. I also read Seller’s and
Sturny’s book on Navigation, which made me
acquainted with the little geometry it contains;
but I never proceeded far in that
science. I read about this time ‘Locke on
the Human Understanding,’ and the ‘Art of
Thinking,’ by Messrs. de Port Royal.</p>

<p>“While I was intent on improving my
language, I met with an English Grammar
(I think it was Greenwood’s), having at the
end of it two little sketches on the ‘Arts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
Rhetoric and Logic,’ the latter finishing with
a dispute in the Socratic method. And soon
after, I procured Xenophon’s ‘Memorable
Things of Socrates,’ wherein there are many
examples of the same method. I was
charmed with it, adopted it, dropped my
abrupt contradiction and positive argumentation,
and put on the humble inquirer.”<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>Hugh Miller, that most admirable Scotchman
and self-made man, relates a similar
experience: “During my sixth year I spelled
my way through the Shorter Catechism,
the Proverbs, and the New Testament, and
then entered upon the highest form in the
dame’s school as a member of the Bible
class. But all the while the process of learning
had been a dark one, which I slowly
mastered, in humble confidence in the awful
wisdom of the schoolmistress, not knowing
whither it tended; when at once my mind
awoke to the meaning of the most delightful
of all narratives,&mdash;the story of Joseph. Was
there ever such a discovery made before! I
actually found out for myself that the art of
reading is the art of finding stories in books;
and from that moment reading became one
of the most delightful of my amusements. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>began by getting into a corner on the dismissal
of the school, and there conning over
to myself the new-found story of Joseph; nor
did one perusal serve;&mdash;the other Scripture
stories followed,&mdash;in especial, the story of
Samson and the Philistines, of David and
Goliath, of the prophets Elijah and Elisha;
and after these came the New Testament
stories and parables. Assisted by my uncles,
too, I began to collect a library in a box of
birch bark about nine inches square, which I
found quite large enough to contain a great
many immortal works: Jack the Giant-Killer,
and Jack and the Bean-Stalk, and the Yellow
Dwarf, and Blue Beard, and Sinbad the
Sailor, and Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin
and the Wonderful Lamp, with several others
of resembling character. Those intolerable
nuisances, the useful-knowledge books, had
not yet arisen, like tenebrious stars on the
educational horizon, to darken the world, and
shed their blighting influence on the opening
intellect of the ‘youthhood;’ and so, from my
rudimental books&mdash;books that made themselves
truly such by their thorough assimilation
with the rudimental mind&mdash;I passed on,
without being conscious of break or line of
division, to books on which the learned are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
content to write commentaries and dissertations,
but which I found to be quite as nice
children’s books as any of the others. Old
Homer wrote admirably for little folk, especially
in the Odyssey; a copy of which, in
the only true translation extant,&mdash;for, judging
from its surpassing interest, and the wrath of
critics, such I hold that of Pope to be,&mdash;I
found in the house of a neighbor. Next
came the Iliad; not, however, in a complete
copy, but represented by four of the six volumes
of Bernard Lintot. With what power
and at how early an age true genius impresses!
I saw, even at this immature period,
that no other writer could cast a javelin with
half the force of Homer. The missiles went
whizzing athwart his pages; and I could see
the momentary gleam of the steel, ere it
buried itself deep in brass and bull-hide. I
next succeeded in discovering for myself a
child’s book, of not less interest than even the
Iliad, which might, I was told, be read on
Sabbaths, in a magnificent old edition of the
‘Pilgrim’s Progress,’ printed on coarse whity-brown
paper, and charged with numerous
wood-cuts, each of which occupied an entire
page, which, on principles of economy, bore
letter-press on the other side....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<p>“In process of time, I devoured, besides
these genial works, Robinson Crusoe, Gulliver’s
Travels, Ambrose on Angels, the ‘judgment
chapter’ in Howie’s Scotch Worthies,
Byron’s Narrative, and the Adventures of
Philip Quarll, with a good many other adventures
and voyages, real and fictitious, part of
a very miscellaneous collection of books made
by my father. It was a melancholy library to
which I had fallen heir. Most of the missing
volumes had been with the master aboard his
vessel when he perished. Of an early edition
of Cook’s Voyages, all the volumes were now
absent, save the first; and a very tantalizing
romance, in four volumes,&mdash;Mrs. Radcliffe’s
‘Mysteries of Udolpho,’&mdash;was represented by
only the earlier two. Small as the collection
was, it contained some rare books,&mdash;among
the rest, a curious little volume entitled ‘The
Miracles of Nature and Art,’ to which we find
Dr. Johnson referring, in one of the dialogues
chronicled by Boswell, as scarce even in his
day, and which had been published, he said,
some time in the seventeenth century by a
bookseller whose shop hung perched on Old
London Bridge, between sky and water.
It contained, too, the only copy I ever saw
of the ‘Memoirs of a Protestant condemned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
the Galleys of France for his Religion,’&mdash;a
work interesting from the circumstance that,
though it bore another name on its titlepage,
it had been translated from the French
for a few guineas by poor Goldsmith, in his
days of obscure literary drudgery, and exhibited
the peculiar excellences of his style. The
collection boasted, besides, of a curious old
book, illustrated by very uncouth plates, that
detailed the perils and sufferings of an English
sailor who had spent the best years of his life
as a slave in Morocco. It had its volumes of
sound theology, too, and of stiff controversy,&mdash;Flavel’s
Works, and Henry’s Commentary,
and Hutchinson on the Lesser Prophets, and
a very old treatise on the Revelations, with
the titlepage away, and blind Jameson’s
volume on the Hierarchy, with first editions
of Naphtali, The Cloud of Witnesses, and the
Hind Let Loose.... Of the works of fact
and incident which it contained, those of the
voyages were my special favorites. I perused
with avidity the Voyages of Anson, Drake,
Raleigh, Dampier, and Captain Woods Rogers;
and my mind became so filled with conceptions
of what was to be seen and done in
foreign parts, that I wished myself big enough
to be a sailor, that I might go and see coral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
islands and burning mountains, and hunt
wild beasts, and fight battles.”<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>William and Robert Chambers, the founders
of the great publishing-house of W. &amp; R.
Chambers, Edinburgh, were self-educated men.
“At little above fourteen years of age,”
writes William, “I was thrown on my own
resources. From necessity, not less than
from choice, I resolved at all hazards to make
the weekly four shillings serve for everything.
I cannot remember entertaining the slightest
despondency on the subject.... I made
such attempts as were at all practicable, while
an apprentice, to remedy the defects of my
education at school. Nothing in that way
could be done in the shop, for there reading
was proscribed. But, allowed to take home
a book for study, I gladly availed myself of
the privilege. The mornings in summer,
when light cost nothing, were my chief reliance.
Fatigued with trudging about, I was
not naturally inclined to rise; but on this and
some other points I overruled the will, and
forced myself to rise at five o’clock, and have
a spell at reading until it was time to think of
moving off,&mdash;my brother, when he was with
me, doing the same. In this way I made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>some progress in French, with the pronunciation
of which I was already familiar from
the speech of the French prisoners of war at
Peebles. I likewise dipped into several books
of solid worth,&mdash;such as Smith’s ‘Wealth of
Nations,’ Locke’s ‘Human Understanding,’
Paley’s ‘Moral Philosophy,’ and Blair’s ‘Belles-Lettres,’&mdash;fixing
the leading facts and theories
in my memory by a note-book for the
purpose. In another book I kept for years
an accurate account of my expenses, not allowing
a single halfpenny to escape record.”</p>

<p>And Robert, the younger brother, confirms
the story, with even more accurate attention
to details. “My brother William and I,” he
says, “lived in lodgings together. Our room
and bed cost three shillings a week.... I
used to be in great distress for want of fire.
I could not afford either that or a candle myself;
so I have often sat by my landlady’s
kitchen fire,&mdash;if fire it could be called, which
was only a little heap of embers,&mdash;reading
Horace and conning my dictionary by a light
which required me to hold the books almost
close to the grate. What a miserable winter
that was! Yet I cannot help feeling proud of
my trials at that time. My brother and I&mdash;he
then between fifteen and sixteen, I between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
thirteen and fourteen&mdash;had made a resolution
together that we would exercise the
last degree of self-denial. My brother actually
saved money out of his income. I remember
seeing him take five-and-twenty shillings out
of a closed box which he kept to receive his
savings; and that was the spare money of
only a twelvemonth.”<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>Rev. Robert Collyer, whose name is known
and honored by every American scholar, says:
“Do you want to know how I manage to talk
to you in this simple Saxon? I will tell you.
I read Bunyan, Crusoe, and Goldsmith when
I was a boy, morning, noon, and night. All
the rest was task work; these were my delight,
with the stories in the Bible, and with Shakspeare
when at last the mighty master came
within our doors.... I took to these as I
took to milk, and, without the least idea what
I was doing, got the taste for simple words
into the very fibre of my nature. There was
day-school for me until I was thirteen years
old, and then I had to turn in and work thirteen
hours a day.... I could not go home
for the Christmas of 1839, and was feeling
very sad about it all, for I was only a boy;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>and, sitting by the fire, an old farmer came
in and said, ‘I notice thou’s fond o’ reading,
so I brought thee summat to read.’ It
was Irving’s ‘Sketch Book.’ I had never
heard of the work. I went at it, and was ‘as
them that dream.’ No such delight had
touched me since the old days of Crusoe.
I saw the Hudson and the Catskills, took
poor Rip at once into my heart, as everybody
has, pitied Ichabod while I laughed at
him, thought the old Dutch feast a most
admirable thing; and long before I was
through, all regret at my lost Christmas had
gone down the wind, and I had found out
there are books and books. That vast
hunger to read never left me. If there was
no candle, I poked my head down to the
fire; read while I was eating, blowing the
bellows, or walking from one place to another.
I could read and walk four miles an hour.
I remember while I was yet a lad reading
Macaulay’s great essay on Bacon, and I could
grasp its wonderful beauty.... Now, give
a boy a passion like this for anything, books
or business, painting or farming, mechanism
or music, and you give him thereby a lever to
lift his world, and a patent of nobility, if the
thing he does is noble.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<p>It may be questioned whether, in these
days of opportunities, it would be possible to
find boys of thirteen and sixteen who would
be able to read understandingly, much less
appreciate and enjoy, those masterpieces of
English literature so eagerly studied by Franklin
and Hugh Miller and the Chambers
brothers. Their mental appetites have been
treated to a different kind of diet. If their
minds have not been dwarfed and stunted by
indulgence in what has been aptly termed
“pen-poison,” their tastes have been perverted
and the growth of their reasoning
powers checked by being fed upon the milk-and-water
stuff recommended as harmless
literature. They are inveterate devourers of
stories, and novels, and the worthless material
which is recommended as good reading, but
which, in reality, is nothing but a “discipline
of debasement.” Better that children should
not read at all, than read much of that which
passes current now-a-days for entertaining
reading.</p>

<p>All children like to read stories. The love
of “the story,” in some form or other, is
indeed a characteristic of the human mind,
and exists everywhere, in all conditions of
life. But stories are the sweets of our mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
existence, and only a few of the best and
greatest have in them the elements which
will lead to a strong and vigorous mind-growth.
Constant feeding upon light literature&mdash;however
good that literature may be
in itself&mdash;will debilitate and corrupt the
mental appetite of the child, much the same
as an unrestrained indulgence in jam and
preserves will undermine and destroy his
physical health. In either case, if no result
more serious occurs, the worst forms of dyspepsia
will follow. Literary dyspepsia is the
most common form of mental disease among
us, and there is no knowing what may be the
extent of its influence upon American civilization.
Fifty per cent of the readers who
patronize our great public libraries have weak
literary stomachs; they cannot digest anything
stronger than that insipid solution, the
last society novel, or anything purer than the
muddy decoctions poured out by the periodical
press. When, of all the reading done
in a public library, eighty per cent is of books
in the different departments of fiction, I doubt
whether, after all, that library is a public benefit.
Yet this is but the natural result of
the loose habits of reading which we encourage
among our children, and cultivate in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
ourselves,&mdash;the habit of reading anything
that comes to hand, provided only that it is
entertaining.</p>

<p>How then shall we so order the child’s
reading as to avoid the formation of desultory
and aimless habits?</p>

<p>Naturally, the earliest reading is the story,&mdash;simple,
short, straightforward recitals of matters
of daily occurrence, of the doings of
children and their parents, their friends or
their pets. “The Nursery,” a little magazine
published in Boston, contains an excellent
variety of such stories. Now and then we
may pick up a good book, too, for this class
of readers; but there are many worthless
books here, as elsewhere, and careful parents
will look well into that which they buy. The
illuminated covers are often the only recommendation
of books of this kind. Numbers
of them are made only for the holiday trade;
the illustrations of many are from second-hand
cuts; and the text is frequently written to fit
the illustrations. A pure, fresh book for a
little child is a treasure to be sought for and
appreciated.</p>

<p>Very early in child-life comes the period
of a belief in fairies; and the reading of
fairy-stories is, to children, a very proper, nay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
a very necessary thing. I pity the boy or
girl who must grow up without having made
intimate acquaintance with “Mother Goose,”
and the wonderful stories of “Jack the Giant-Killer,”
and “Blue Beard,” and “Cinderella,”
and those other strange tales as old as the
race itself, and yet new to every succeeding
generation. They are a part of the inheritance
of the English-speaking people, and belong,
as a kind of birthright, to every intelligent
child.</p>

<p>As your little reader advances in knowledge
and reading-ability, he should be treated to
stronger food. Grimm’s “Household Stories”
and the delightful “Wonder Stories” of Hans
Christian Andersen, should form a part of the
library of every child as he passes through the
“fairy-story period” of his life; nor can we
well omit to give him Charles Kingsley’s
“Water Babies,” and “Alice’s Adventures in
Wonderland.” And now, or later, as circumstances
shall dictate, we may introduce him
to that prince of all wonder-books, “The
Arabian Nights’ Entertainment,” in an edition
carefully adapted to children’s reading.
The tales related in this book “are not ours
by birth, but they have nevertheless taken
their place amongst the similar things of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
own which constitute the national literary
inheritance. Altogether, it is a glorious book,
and one to which we cannot well show enough
of respect.”</p>

<p>And while your reader lingers in the great
world of poetic fancy and child-wonder, let
him revel for a while in those enchanting idyls
and myths which delighted mankind when the
race was young and this earth was indeed a
wonder-world. These he may find, apparelled
in a dress adapted to our modern notions of
propriety, in Hawthorne’s “Wonder Book” and
“Tanglewood Tales,” in Kingsley’s “Greek
Heroes,” and, in a more prosaic form, in
Cox’s “Tales of Ancient Greece;” and in
“The Story of Siegfried,” and, later, in Morris’s
“Sigurd the Volsung,” he may read the
no less charming myths of our own northern
ancestors, and the world-famous legend of
the Nibelungen heroes. Then, by a natural
transition, you advance into the border-land
which lies between the world of pure fancy
and the domains of sober-hued reality. You
introduce your reader to some wholesome
adaptations of those Mediæval Romances,
which, with their one grain of fact to a thousand
of fable, gave such noble delight to lords
and ladies in the days of chivalry. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
you will find in Sidney Lanier’s “Boy’s King
Arthur” and “Boy’s Mabinogion;” in “The
Story of Roland,” by the author of the present
volume; and in Bulfinch’s “Legends of
Charlemagne” and “The Age of Chivalry.”</p>

<p>Do you understand now to what point you
have led your young reader? You have
simply followed the order of nature and of
human development, and you have gradually&mdash;almost
imperceptibly even to yourself&mdash;brought
him out of the world of child-wonder
and fairy-land, through the middle ground of
chivalric romance, to the very borders of the
domains of history. He is ready and eager
to enter into the realms of sober-hued truth;
but I would not advise undue haste in this
matter. The mediæval romances have inspired
him with a desire to know more of
those days when knights-errant rode over sea
and land to do battle in the name of God and
for the honor of their king, the Church, and
the ladies; he wants to know something more
nearly the truth than that which the minstrels
and story-tellers of the Middle Ages can tell
him. And yet he is not prepared for a sudden
transition from romance to history. Let
him read “Ivanhoe;” then give him Howard
Pyle’s “Story of Robin Hood” and Lanier’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
“Boy’s Percy;” and if you care to allow him
so much more fiction, let him read Madame
Colomb’s “Franchise” as translated and
adapted by Davenport Adams in his “Page,
Squire, and Knight.” Can you withhold history
longer from your reader? I think not.
He will demand some authentic knowledge of
Richard the Lion-hearted, and of King John,
and of the Saxons and Normans, and of the
Crusades, and of the Saracens, and of Charlemagne
and his peers. Lose not your opportunity,
but pass over with your pupil into the
promised land. The transition is easy,&mdash;imperceptible,
in fact,&mdash;and, leaving fiction and
“the story” behind you, you enter the fields
of truth and history. As for books, it is
difficult now to advise; but there are Abbott’s
little histories,&mdash;give him the “History of
Richard I.” to begin with, then get the whole
set for him. Yonge’s “Young Folks’ History
of England,” or Dickens’s “Child’s History”
will also be in demand. The way is easy
now, the road is open, you need no further
guidance&mdash;only, keep straight ahead.</p>

<p>There are other books, of course, which the
young reader will find in his way, and which
it is altogether proper and necessary that he
should read. For instance, there is “Robin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>son
Crusoe,” without a knowledge of which
the boy loses one of his dearest enjoyments.
“How youth passed long ago, when there
was no Crusoe to waft it away in fancy to the
Pacific and fix it upon the lonely doings of
the shipwrecked mariner, is inconceivable; but
we can readily suppose that it must have been
different,” says Robert Chambers. And no
substitute for the original Robinson will answer.
Not one of the ten thousand tales of
adventure recently published for boys will fill
the niche which this book fills, or atone in the
least for any neglect of its merits. “The
Swiss Family Robinson” approaches nearest
in excellence to Defoe’s immortal creation,
and may very profitably form a part of every
boy’s or girl’s library. Then, among the
really unexceptionable books, of the healthful,
hopeful, truthful sort, I may name “Tom
Brown’s School Days at Rugby,” Lamb’s
“Tales from Shakspeare,” Mitchell’s “About
Old Story-Tellers;” the inimitable “Bodley
Books,” Bayard Taylor’s “Boys of Other
Countries,” Abbott’s “Franconia Stories,” and
a few others in the line of History or Travels,
to be mentioned in future chapters. These
I believe to be, in every sense, proper, wholesome
books, free from all kinds of mannerisms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
free from improper language, free from sickly
sentiment and “gush;” and these, if not the
most instructive books, are the sort of books
which the child or youth should read as a
kind of relish or supplement to the more
methodical course of reading which I have
elsewhere indicated.</p>

<p>In this careful direction of the child’s
reading, and in the cultivation of his literary
taste, if you have succeeded in bringing him
to the point which we have indicated, you
have done much towards forming his character
for life. There is little danger that bad
books will ever possess any attractions for
him; he will henceforth be apt to go right of
his own accord, preferring the wholesome and
the true to any of the flashy allurements of the
“literary slums and grog-shops,” which so
abound and flourish in these days.</p>

<p>But perhaps the fundamental error in determining
what books children shall read lies in
the very popular notion that to read much,
and to derive pleasure and profit from our
reading, many books are necessary. And the
greatest obstacle in the way of forming and
directing a proper taste for good reading is
to be found, not in the scarcity, but in the
superabundance of reading matter. The great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
flood of periodical literature for young people
is the worst hindrance to the formation
of right habits in reading. Some of these
periodicals are simply unadulterated “pen
poison,” designed not only to enrich their
projectors, but to deprave the minds of those
who read. Others are published, doubtless,
from pure motives and with the best intentions;
but, being managed by inexperienced
or incapable editors, they are, at the best,
but thin dilutions of milk-and-water literature,
leading to mental imbecility and starvation.
The periodicals fit to be placed in the hands
of reading children may be numbered on half
your fingers; and even these should not be
read without due discrimination.</p>

<p>Too great a variety of books or papers
placed at the disposal of inexperienced readers
offers a premium to desultoriness, and
fosters and encourages the habit of devouring
every species of literary food that comes to
hand. Hence we should beware not only of
the bad, but of too great plenty of the good.
“The benefit of a right good book,” says Mr.
Hudson, “all depends upon this, that its virtue
just <i>soak</i> into the mind, and there become
a living, generative force. To be running and
rambling over a great many books, tasting a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
little here, a little there, and tying up with
none, is good for nothing; nay, worse than
nothing. Such a process of unceasing change
is also a discipline of perpetual emptiness.
The right method in the culture of the mind
is to take a few choice books, and weave
about them</p>

<p class="center"><b>Hints on the Formation of School
Libraries.</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> sort of reading are our schools planting an appetite
for? Are they really doing anything to instruct and
form the mental taste, so that the pupils on leaving them
may be safely left to choose their reading for themselves?
It is clear in evidence that they are far from educating the
young to take pleasure in what is intellectually noble and
sweet. The statistics of our public libraries show that
some cause is working mightily to prepare them only for
delight in what is both morally and intellectually mean
and foul. It would not indeed be fair to charge our public
schools with positively giving this preparation; but it is
their business to forestall and prevent such a result. If,
along with the faculty of reading, they cannot also impart
some safeguards of taste and habit against such a result,
will the system prove a success?&mdash;<span class="smcap">Henry N. Hudson.</span></p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent"><span class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/m.png" width="80" height="79" alt="M" /></span>UCH is being said, now-a-days, about
the utility of school libraries; and
in some instances much ill-directed,
if not entirely misdirected, labor is
being expended in their formation. Public
libraries are not necessarily public benefits;<span class="pagenum padl2"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
and school libraries, unless carefully selected
and judiciously managed, will not prove to
be unmixed blessings. There are several
questions which teachers and school officers
should seriously consider before setting themselves
to the task of establishing a library;
and no teacher who is not himself a knower
of books, and a reader, should presume to
regulate and direct the reading of others.</p>

<p>What are the objects of a school library?
They are twofold: First, to aid in cultivating
a taste for good reading; second, to supply
materials for supplementary study and independent
research. Now, neither of these objects
can be attained unless your library is
composed of books selected especially with
reference to the capabilities and needs of
your pupils. Dealing, as you do, with pupils
of various degrees of intellectual strength,
warped by every variety of moral influence
and home training, the cultivation of a taste
for good reading among them is no small
matter. To do this, your library must contain
none but truly good books. It is a great
mistake to suppose that every collection of
books placed in a schoolhouse is a library;
and yet that is the name which is applied to
many very inferior collections. It is no un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>common
thing to find these so-called libraries
composed altogether of the odds and ends
of literature,&mdash;of donations, entirely worthless
to their donors; of second-hand school-books;
of Patent Office Reports and other
public documents; and of the dilapidated
remains of some older and equally worthless
collection of books: and with these you talk
about cultivating a taste for good reading!
One really good book, a single copy of “St.
Nicholas,” is worth more than all this trash.
Get it out of sight at once! The value of
a library&mdash;no matter for what purpose it has
been founded&mdash;depends not upon the number
of its books, but upon their character.
And so the first rule to be observed in the
formation of a school library is, Buy it at first
hand, even though you should begin with a
single volume, and shun all kinds of donations,
unless they be donations of cash, or
books of unquestionable value.</p>

<p>In selecting books for purchase, you will
have an eye single to the wants of the students
who are to use them. A school library
should be in no sense a public circulating
library. You cannot cater to the literary
tastes of the public, and at the same time
serve the best interests of your pupils. Books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
relating to history, to biography, and to travel
will form a very large portion of your library.
These should be chosen with reference to
the age and mental capacity of those who are
to read them. No book should be bought
merely because it is a good book, but because
we know that it can be made useful in the
attainment of certain desired ends. The
courses of reading indicated in the following
chapters of this work, it is hoped, will assist
you largely in making a wise selection as well
as in directing to a judicious use of books.
For the selection of a book is only half of
your duty: the profitable use of it is the
other half; and this lesson should be early
taught to your pupils.</p>

<p>If, through means of your school library or
otherwise, you succeed in enlisting the interest
of a young person in profitable methodical
reading, you have accomplished a great
deal towards the forwarding of his education
and the formation of his character. It is a
great mistake to suppose that a boy of twelve
cannot pursue a course of reading in English
history; if properly directed and encouraged,
he will enjoy it far better than the perusal
of the milk-and-water story-books which, under
the guise of “harmless juvenile litera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>ture,”
have been placed in his hands by
well-meaning teachers or parents.</p>

<p>In a former chapter I have shown you
how, with a library of only fifty volumes, you
may have in your possession the very best
of all that the world’s master-minds have ever
written,&mdash;food, as I have said, for study, and
meditation, and mind growth enough for a lifetime.
Such a library is worth more than ten
thousand volumes of the ordinary “popular”
kind of books. So, also, the reading of a
very few books, carefully and methodically,
by your pupils&mdash;the constant presence of
the very best books in our language, and the
exclusion of the trashy and the vile&mdash;will
give them more real enjoyment and infinitely
greater profit than the desultory or hasty reading
of many volumes. A small library is to
be despised only when it contains inferior
books.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="center"><b>Courses of Reading in History.</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">History</span>, at least in its state of ideal perfection, is a
compound of poetry and philosophy.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Macaulay.</span></p>

<p>Let us search more and more into the Past; let all
men explore it as the true fountain of knowledge, by
whose light alone, consciously or unconsciously employed,
can the Present and the Future be interpreted or guessed
at.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Carlyle.</span></p>

<p>History is a voice forever sounding across the centuries
the laws of right and wrong. Opinions alter, manners
change, creeds rise and fall; but the moral law is written
on the tablets of eternity.... Justice and truth alone
endure and live. Injustice and falsehood may be long-lived,
but doomsday comes at last to them in French revolutions
and other terrible ways. That is one lesson of history.
Another is, that we should draw no horoscopes; that we
should expect little, for what we expect will not come to
pass.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Froude.</span></p>

<p>The student is to read history actively and not passively;
to esteem his own life the text, and books the commentary.
Thus compelled, the Muse of history will utter oracles, as
never to those who do not respect themselves. I have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
expectation that any man will read history aright who
thinks that what was done in a remote age, by men whose
names have resounded far, has any deeper sense than what
he is doing to-day.... The instinct of the mind, the purpose
of nature, betrays itself in the use we make of the
signal narrations of history.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Emerson.</span></p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent"><span class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/i.png" width="80" height="77" alt="I" /></span> venture to propose the following
courses of reading in history.
Properly modified with reference to
individual needs and capabilities,
these lists will prove to be safe helps and
guides to younger as well as older readers, to
classes in high schools and colleges as well
as private students and specialists. To read
all the works here mentioned, as carefully and
critically as the nature of their contents demands,
would require no inconsiderable portion
of one’s reading lifetime. Such a thing
is not expected. The wise teacher or the
judicious scholar will select from the list that
which is most proper for him, and which best
meets his wants, or aids him most in the pursuit
of his native aim.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Courses of Reading in Geography and
Natural History</b></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/g.png" width="80" height="76" alt="G" /></span>EOGRAPHY is learned best by the
careful reading of books of travel.
Pupils would derive infinitely more
knowledge by the use, under judicious
instructors, of a library of this sort, than
by years of drudging through those masses of
inanity known as School Geographies. The
following list is designed chiefly to aid teachers
in the selection of books suitable for
geographical study at school, and to assist
private readers in the choice of useful and
entertaining works on the various subjects of
interest in our own and foreign countries.</p>

<p>A good atlas is the first desideratum, and
is an indispensable auxiliary to the course of
reading here indicated. Rand, McNally, &amp;
Co.’s Atlas is one of the latest publications,
and perhaps the most accurate and complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
in the market. Among other very good works
of this kind we may mention Gray’s, Johnson’s,
Colton’s, and Zell’s, any one of which will answer
all the ordinary purposes of the reader.
When no complete work is available, the maps
in the larger school geographies will render
very fair service.</p>

<p>“Taking up a book like Arnauld, and reading
a chapter of his lively, manly sense,” says
Rab’s friend, “is like throwing your manuals,
and scalpels, and microscopes, and natural
(most unnatural) orders out of your hand and
head, and taking a game with the Grange
Club, or a run to the top of Arthur Seat.
Exertion quickens your pulse, expands your
lungs, makes your blood warmer and redder,
fills your mouth with the pure waters of relish,
strengthens and supples your legs; and though
on your way to the top you may encounter
rocks, and baffling débris, and gusts of fierce
winds rushing out upon you from behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
corners, just as you will find, in Arnauld and
all truly serious and honest books of the kind,
difficulties and puzzles, winds of doctrine, and
deceitful mists, still you are rewarded at the
top by the wide view. You see, as from a
tower, the end of all. You look into the perfections
and relations of things; you see the
clouds, the bright lights, and the everlasting
hills on the horizon. You come down the
hill a happier, a better, and a hungrier man,
and of a better mind. But, as we said, you
must eat the book,&mdash;you must crush it, and
cut it with your teeth, and swallow it; just as
you must walk up, and not be carried up, the
hill, much less imagine you are there, or look
upon a picture of what you would see were
you up, however accurately or artistically
done; no,&mdash;you yourself must <i>do</i> both.”</p>

<p>The same may be said of all books that are
the most truly helpful to us, and mind-lifting.
It is the hard reading that profits most,
provided, always, that due care be taken to
digest that which is read. Yet I would not
recommend the same strong diet or the same
severe exercise to every person, or even to
any considerable proportion of readers. One
man may be a palm, as says Dr. Collyer, and
another a pine; that which is wisdom to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
one may be incomprehensible folly to the
other. But those whose mental constitutions
are sufficiently vigorous to digest and assimilate

<p>A course of reading which shall include any
number of the works here mentioned will be
no child’s play; it will involve the severest
exercise of the thinking powers, but it will
enable you “to look into the perfections and
relations of things, and to see the clouds, the
bright lights, and the everlasting hills on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
horizon.” The reading of such books is like
the training of a gymnast; it will lead to the
healthy development of the parts most skillfully
exercised, but the strength of him who
exercises should never be too severely tested.
Would you prefer a lighter course of reading,
but one which will probably lead you into
pleasanter paths of contemplation and reflection,
and finally open up to your view a prospect
equally boundless and grand? Allow
me to suggest the following, which is neither
philosophical nor religious, in the strictest acceptation
of these terms, but which leads us
to an acquaintance with that which is best in
both.</p>

<p>We shall begin with the Bible, and throughout
the course we shall make that book our
grand rallying-point. “Read the Bible reverently
and attentively,” says Sir Matthew Hale;
“set your heart upon it, and lay it up in your
memory, and make it the direction of your
life: it will make you a wise and good man.”
From the reverential reading of the Bible,
which to most of us is rather an act of religious
duty than of intellectual effort, we turn
to the great masterpieces of antiquity. In the
Phædo and the Apology and Crito of Plato,
we find the ripest thoughts of the world’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
greatest thinker; then we turn to Aristotle’s
Ethics, and, afterwards, we compare the doctrines
of the Greek philosophers with the
Teachings of Confucius and of Mencius.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> If
we have supplemented these readings with
the proper acquaintance with ancient history,
we shall now be ready to understand
the great poems of antiquity, and to read
them in a light different from that which we
have hitherto known. We read the Iliad, and
the Odyssey, and the Greek tragedians; then
the old Indian epics, Arnold’s “The Light
of Asia,” and Swamy’s “Dialogues and Discourses
of Gotama Buddha.” Descending
now to more modern times,&mdash;for we would
not make this course a long one,&mdash;we turn
again to our Bible, and thoroughly acquaint
ourselves with “the unsurpassedly simple, loving,
perfect idyls of the life and death of
Christ,” as we find them in the New Testament.
After this, we shall obtain more exalted
ideas of the brotherhood of the human
race and the “hope of the nations,” if we
spend some time in the study of the majestic
expressions of the universal conscience found
in such works as the “Vishnu Sarma” of the
Hindoos, the “Gulistan” of Saadi, the “Sentences”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>of Epictetus, and the “Thoughts” of
Marcus Aurelius Antoninus. Then, to get at
the poetic interpretation of the teachings of
Mohammed, we read the “Pearls of Faith;
or, Islam’s Rosary,” and Lane Poole’s “Selections
from the Koran.” Returning to the
study of Christian ethics and poetry, we take
up the “Confessions of Saint Augustine,”
and the “Discourse” of Saint Bernard, and
then the “Imitation of Christ,” by Thomas
à Kempis. We read Milton’s “Paradise
Lost” again, and Bunyan’s “Pilgrim’s Progress;”
and we enjoy the wealth of imagery
in Jeremy Taylor’s “Holy Living and Holy
Dying.” Holy George Herbert’s “Sacred
Poems and Private Ejaculations” claim our
attention for a time, and then we take up
Pascal’s “Thoughts,” and selections from
Fénelon’s “Telemachus” and “Dialogues of
the Dead.” Finally, we read Wordsworth’s
“Excursion,” and Keble’s “Christian Year,”
and return after all to a further perusal of
the Bible and the poems of antiquity.</p>

<p>You may say that this course is rather fragmentary,
and so it is; but it differs from the
other courses which I have indicated, in that
it is undertaken as a heart-work rather than a
head-work. Unlike the course just preceding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
it has to do with our emotional and devotional
natures rather than with our highest powers
of thinking and reasoning. With few exceptions
only, the books here mentioned are
voices out of the past, speaking to us of the
human soul’s belief and experience in different
ages of the world and under different dispensations.
“I suppose,” says George Eliot,
speaking of the “Imitation of Christ,”&mdash;“I
suppose that is the reason why the small old-fashioned
book, for which you need only pay
sixpence at a book-stall, works miracles to this
day, turning bitter waters into sweetness;
while expensive sermons and treatises, newly
issued, leave all things as they were before.
It was written down by a hand that waited for
the heart’s prompting; it is the chronicle of
a solitary, hidden anguish, struggle, trust, and
triumph,&mdash;not written on velvet cushions to
teach endurance to those who are treading
with bleeding feet on the stones. And so it
remains to all time a lasting record of human
needs and human consolations; the voice of
a brother who, ages ago, felt and suffered
and renounced,&mdash;in the cloister, perhaps with
serge gown and tonsured head, with much
chanting and long fasts, and with a fashion of
speech different from ours,&mdash;but under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
same silent far-off heavens, and with the same
passionate desires, the same strivings, the
same failures, the same weariness.”</p>

<p>Writing of works like these, Emerson says:
“Their communications are not to be given
or taken with the lips and the end of the
tongue, but out of the glow of the cheek,
and with the throbbing heart.... These are
the Scriptures which the missionary might
well carry over prairie, desert, and ocean, to
Siberia, Japan, Timbuctoo. Yet he will find
that the spirit which is in them journeys faster
than he, and greets him on his arrival,&mdash;was
there long before him. The missionary must
be carried by it, and find it there, or he goes
in vain. Is there any geography in these
things? We call them Asiatic, we call them
primeval; but perhaps that is only optical,
for Nature is always equal to herself, and
there are as good eyes and ears now in the
planet as ever were. Only these ejaculations
of the soul are uttered one or a few at a
time, at long intervals, and it takes millenniums
to make a Bible.”</p>

<p>We are brought now naturally to the subject
of Theological Literature. The number
of books in this department is very great, and
there are wide differences of opinion with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
regard to the merits of many of the best-known
works. Without attempting to select always
the best, I shall name only a sufficient number
of books necessary for the use of such
non-professional readers as may desire to acquire
a moderate knowledge of the commonly
accepted theological doctrines&mdash;</p>

able preacher when you have but a mean one
to hear. Every congregation cannot hear the
most judicious or powerful preachers; but
every single person may read the books of
the most powerful and judicious. Preachers
may be silenced or banished, when books
may be at hand; books may be kept at a
smaller charge than preachers: we may choose
books which treat of that very subject which
we desire to hear of. Books we may have at
hand every day and hour, when we can have
sermons but seldom, and at set times. If
sermons be forgotten, they are gone. But a
book we may read over and over until we
remember it; and if we forget it, may again
peruse it at our pleasure or at our leisure.”<br /><br /></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>On the Practical Study of English
Literature.</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ocean of literature is without limit. How then shall
we be able to perform a voyage, even to a moderate distance,
if we waste our time in dalliance on the shore? Our
only hope is in exertion. Let our only reward be that of
industry.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ringelbergius.</span></p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent"><span class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/t.png" width="80" height="81" alt="T" /></span>HE student of English literature has
indeed embarked upon a limitless
ocean. A lifetime of study will serve
only to make him acquainted with
parts of that great expanse which lies open
before him. He should pursue his explorations
earnestly, and with the inquiring spirit of
a true discoverer. His thirst for knowledge
should be unquenchable; he should long
always for that mind food which brings the
right kind of mind growth. He should not
rest satisfied with merely superficial attainments,
but should strive for that thoroughness<span class="pagenum padl2"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
of knowledge without which there can be
neither excellence nor enjoyment.</p>

<p>English literature is not to be learned from
manuals. They are only helps,&mdash;charts,
buoys, light-houses, if you will call them so;
or they serve to you the purposes of guide-books.
What do you think of the would-be
tourist who stays at home and studies his
Baedeker with the foolish thought that he is
actually seeing the countries which the book
describes? And yet I have known students,
and not a few teachers, do a thing equally as
foolish. With a Morley, or a Shaw, or even a
Brooke in their hands, and a few names and
dates at their tongues’ ends, they imagine
themselves viewing the great ocean of literature,
ploughing its surface and exploring its
depths, when in reality they are only wasting
their time “in dalliance on the shore.”</p>

<p>English literature does not consist in a
mere array of names and dates and short
biographical sketches of men who have written
books. Biography is biography; literature
“is a record of the best thoughts.” But
the former is frequently studied in place of
the latter. “For once that we take down our
Milton, and read a book of that ‘voice,’ as
Wordsworth says, ‘whose sound is like the sea,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
we take up fifty times a magazine with something
about Milton, or about Milton’s grandmother,
or a book stuffed with curious facts
about the houses in which he lived, and the
juvenile ailments of his first wife.”<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> Instead
of becoming acquainted at first hand with
books in which are stored the energies of the
past, we content ourselves with knowing only
something about the men who wrote them.
Instead of admiring with our own eyes the
architectural beauties of St. Paul’s Cathedral,
we read a biography of Sir Christopher Wren.</p>

<p>Again, it must be borne in mind that literature
is one thing, and the history of literature
is another. The study of the latter,
however important, cannot be substituted for
that of the former; yet it is not desirable to
separate the two. To acquire any serviceable
knowledge of a book, you will be greatly
aided by knowing under what peculiar conditions
it was conceived and produced,&mdash;the
history of the country, the manners of
the people, the status of morals and politics
at the time it was written. Between history
and literature there is a mutual relationship
which should not be overlooked. “A book
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>is the offspring of the aggregate intellect of
humanity,” and it gives back to humanity, in
the shape of new ideas and new combinations
of old ideas, not only all that which it has
derived from it, but more,&mdash;increased intellectual
vitality, and springs of action hitherto
unknown.</p>

<p>In the study of literature, one should begin
with an author and with a subject not too
difficult to understand. A beginner will be
likely to find but little comfort in Chaucer or
Spenser, or even in Emerson; but after he
has worked up to them he may study them
with unbounded delight. For a ready understanding
and correct appreciation of the great
masterpieces of English literature, a knowledge
of Greek and Roman mythology and
history is almost indispensable. The student
will find the courses of historical reading given
in a former chapter of this book of much
value in supplementing his literary studies.</p>

<p>The great works of the world’s masterminds
should be studied together, with reference
to the similarity of their subject-matter.
For example, the reading of Shakspeare will
give occasion to the study of dramatic literature
in all its forms; the reading of Milton’s
“Paradise Lost” will introduce us to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
the great epics, and to heroic poetry in general;
Sir Walter Scott’s “Lay of the Last
Minstrel” will lead naturally to the romance
literature of modern and mediæval times;
Chaucer’s “Canterbury Tales” fitly illustrate
the story-telling phase of poetry; the study
of lyric poetry may centre around the old
ballads, the poems of Robert Burns, and the
religious hymns of our language; Bunyan’s
“Pilgrim’s Progress” introduces us to allegory,
and Milton’s “Lycidas” to elegiac and
pastoral poetry; and to know the best specimens
of argumentative prose, we begin with
the speeches of Daniel Webster and end with
the orations of Demosthenes.</p>

<p>The following schemes for the study of different
departments of English literature have
been tested both with private students and
with classes at school. Of course, many of
the books mentioned are to be used chiefly
as works of reference; some of them may be
conveniently omitted in case it is desirable
to abridge the course, and others may be
exchanged for similar works upon the same
subject.</p>

the grinding is low,&mdash;where shall we find the
beds of asphodel? Can any couch be more

of Books? The occupations of the morning and

<p style="font-size: .8em;">These stories have been everywhere received with the greatest
favor. They cover the most interesting and exciting periods of
Swedish and Finnish history. They combine history and romance,
and the two are woven together in so skilful and attractive a manner
that the reader of one volume is rarely satisfied until he has
read all. Of their distinguished author the <i>Saturday Review</i>,
London, says: “He enjoys the greatest celebrity among living
Swedish writers;” and R. H. Stoddard has styled them “the
most important and certainly the most readable series of foreign
fiction that has been translated into English for many years.”
They should stand on the shelves of every library, public and
private, beside the works of Sir Walter Scott.</p>

<p class="center f08">The Graphic, New York, says:</p>

<p style="font-size: .8em;">“Topelius is evidently a great romancer,&mdash;a great romancer in
the manner of Walter Scott. At moments in his writing there is
positive inspiration, a truth and vivid reality that are startling.”</p>

<p class="center f08">The Sun, Philadelphia, says:</p>

<p style="font-size: .8em;">“We would much prefer teaching a youth Swedish history
from the novels of Topelius than from any book of strict historical
narrative.”</p>

<p style="font-size: .8em;">Of the “Life of Liszt,” the <i>Herald</i> (Boston) says: “It is

in all that it undertakes to portray.”</p>

<p style="font-size: .8em;">Of the “Life of Haydn,” the <i>Gazette</i> (Boston) says: “No

<p style="font-size: .8em;">Of the “Life of Mozart,” the <i>Standard</i> says: “Mozart supplies
a fascinating subject for biographical treatment. He lives
in these pages somewhat as the world saw him, from his marvellous
boyhood till his untimely death.”</p>

<p style="font-size: .8em;">Of the “Life of Wagner,” the <i>American</i> (Baltimore) says:
“It gives in vigorous outlines those events of the life of the tone
poet which exercised the greatest influences upon his artistic
career.... It is a story of a strange life devoted to lofty aims.”</p>

<p style="font-size: .8em;">Of the “Life of Beethoven,” the <i>National Journal of Education</i>
says: “Beethoven was great and noble as a man, and
his artistic creations were in harmony with his great nature.
The story of his life, outlined in this volume, is of the deepest
interest.”</p>

<p style="font-size: .8em;">The series of four volumes forms, perhaps, the choicest
addition to the English language that has been made in recent
years.</p>

<p style="font-size: .8em;">Of “Memories,” the London <i>Academy</i> says: “It is a prose
poem.... Its beauty and pathos show us a fresh phase of a
many-sided mind, to which we already owe large debts of
gratitude.”</p>

<p style="font-size: .8em;">Of “Graziella,” the Boston <i>Post</i> says: “It is full of beautiful
sentiment, unique and graceful in style, of course, as were
all the writings that left the hands of this distinguished French
author.”</p>

<p style="font-size: .8em;">Of “Madeleine,” the New York <i>Evening Mail</i> says: “It is
one of the most exquisite love tales that ever was written,
abounding in genuine pathos and sparkling wit, and so pure in
its sentiment that it may be read by a child.”</p>

<p style="font-size: .8em;">Of “Marie,” the Cincinnati <i>Gazette</i> says: “It is one of the
purest, sweetest little narratives that we have read for a long
time. It is a little classic, and a Russian classic, too.”</p>

<p class="center f08">The Boston Transcript says:</p>

<p style="font-size: .8em;">“The work shows thorough study and excellent judgment,
and we can warmly recommend it to schools and private classes
for reading as an admirable text-book.”</p>

<p class="center f08">The New York Evening Mail says:</p>

<p style="font-size: .8em;">“What the author proposed to do was to convey to her readers
a clear idea of the variety, extent, and richness of English
literature.... She has done just what she intended to do, and
done it well.”</p>

<p class="center f08">The New York Nation says:</p>

<p style="font-size: .8em;">“It is refreshing to find a book designed for young readers
which seeks to give only what will accomplish the real aim of
the study; namely, to excite an interest in English literature,
cultivate a taste for what is best in it, and thus lay a foundation
on which they can build after reading.”</p>

<p class="center f08">Prof. Moses Coit Tyler says:</p>

<p style="font-size: .8em;">“I have had real satisfaction in looking over the book. There
are some opinions with which I do not agree; but the main thing
about the book is a good thing; namely, its hearty, wholesome
love of English literature, and the honest, unpretending, but
genial and conversational, manner in which that love is uttered.
It is a charming book to read, and it will breed in its readers the
appetite to read English literature for themselves.”</p>

<p style="font-size: .8em;">“Written apparently for young readers, it yet possesses a
charm of manner which will recommend it to all.”&mdash;<i>The Examiner,
London.</i></p>

<p style="font-size: .8em;">“It is only when we take up such a book as this that we realize
how rich in interest is the mythology of Greece.”&mdash;<i>Inquirer,
Philadelphia.</i></p>

<p style="font-size: .8em;">“Admirable in style, and level with a child’s comprehension.
These versions might well find a place in every family.”&mdash;<i>The
Nation, New York.</i></p>

<p style="font-size: .8em;">“The author invests these stories with a charm of narrative
entirely peculiar. The book is a rich one in every way.”&mdash;<i>Standard,

<p style="font-size: .8em;">“In Mr. Cox will be found yet another name to be enrolled
among those English writers who have vindicated for this country
an honorable rank in the investigation of Greek history.”&mdash;<i>Edinburgh

<p style="font-size: .8em;">“It is doubtful if these tales&mdash;antedating history in their
origin, and yet fresh with all the charms of youth to all who
read them for the first time&mdash;were ever before presented in so
chaste and popular form.”&mdash;<i>Golden Rule, Boston.</i></p>

<p style="font-size: .8em;">“The grace with which these old tales of the mythology are
re-told makes them as enchanting to the young as familiar fairy
tales or the ‘Arabian Nights.’... We do not know of a Christmas
book which promises more lasting pleasures.”&mdash;<i>Publishers’
Weekly.</i></p>

<p style="font-size: .8em;">“Its exterior fits it to adorn the drawing-room table, while its

quite too scantily furnished.”&mdash;<i>Tribune, Chicago.</i></p>

times to the foundation of the existing Republic.”&mdash;<i>Cincinnati

may be commended as the best of its kind that has yet
appeared.”&mdash;<i>Bulletin, Philadelphia.</i></p>

<p style="font-size: .8em;">“A book both instructive and entertaining. It is not a dry
compendium of dates and facts, but a charmingly written history.”&mdash;<i>Christian
Union, New York.</i></p>

<p style="font-size: .8em;">“After a careful examination of its contents, we are able to
conscientiously give it our heartiest commendation. We know no
elementary history of France that can at all be compared with
it.”&mdash;<i>Living Church.</i></p>

<p style="font-size: .8em;">“A spirited and entertaining sketch of the French people and
nation,&mdash;one that will seize and hold the attention of all bright
boys and girls who have a chance to read it.”&mdash;<i>Sunday Afternoon,
Springfield (Mass.).</i></p>

<p style="font-size: .8em;">“We find its descriptions universally good, that it is admirably
simple and direct in style, without waste of words or timidity of
opinion. The book represents a great deal of patient labor and
conscientious study.”&mdash;<i>Courant, Hartford (Conn.).</i></p>

<p style="font-size: .8em;">“Miss Kirkland has composed her ‘Short History of France’
in the way in which a history for young people ought to be written;
that is, she has aimed to present a consecutive and agreeable
story, from which the reader can not only learn the names of
kings and the succession of events, but can also receive a vivid
and permanent impression as to the characters, modes of life,
and the spirit of different periods.”&mdash;<i>The Nation, New York.</i></p>
